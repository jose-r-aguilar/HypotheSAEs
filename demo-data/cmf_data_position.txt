1	pass the framework 
1	dear members of the state board of education as the director of calculus roundtable i am pleased to express our strong support for the adoption of the california math framework this framework is crucial to promoting equitable access to rigorous math coursework for all california children regardless of their background or socioeconomic status it is particularly important to highlight the need for cultural relevancy in delivering math instruction especially in districts with a minority majority student population by incorporating cultural relevancy into the curriculum students are able to see themselves in the coursework and find solutions to problems that are relevant to their own experiences in turn this to higher engagement and greater academic success for all students research has shown that students who are provided with culturally relevant instruction perform better academically and feel more engaged in their education this is especially true for students from underrepresented communities who often feel disconnected from the traditional curriculum by embracing cultural relevancy in math instruction we can work to ensure that all students have the opportunity to express their own brilliance and reach their full potential we urge the state board of education to adopt the california math framework and continue to prioritize equity and cultural relevancy in education thank you for your consideration sincerely jim hollis director calculus roundtable  
1	i am writing to support offering algebra to 8th graders in ca if we want all of our kids to have opportunities to secure highpaying jobs even in the building trades btw math isnt just used for coding or if we want our citizens to be financially literate we need high quality math instruction in our k12 schools and no i dont believe jo bowlers theories qualify as such kids who are interested in math and want to push themselves should not be held back to serve adults political biases or enrich consultants i find the education bureaucracys ideas about childrens abilities condescending and offensive sfs math experiment is largely a failure i know this because i live there and am a parent the public school system that worked well for my husband and me has been so thoroughly dismantled and redirected from its core mission of education that it was not a viable option for our children it is a tragedy that should not be compounded

-1	re july 1213 2023 agenda item no 17 mayacamas charter middle school dear president darlinghammond and board members on behalf of the napa foundation for options in education operator of the mayacamas charter middle school i write to request the removal of item 17 from the state boards july 1213 agenda to set aside the state board of educations september 15 2022 reversal of the denials of the mayacamas charter middle school petition to comply with a writ of mandate to be issued in napa valley unified school district v california state board of education and california school boards associations education legal alliance v california state board of educationé respectfully the item is premature and legally improper for at least three reasons first under the bagleykeene opening meeting act this lateadded item cannot be placed on the agenda without a vote of twothirds of the members of the state board on the basis that there is a need to take immediate action government code section 11253 there is no item on the agenda to approve the addition of this new item after the expiration of the deadline to post the agenda nor a need to take immediate action and therefore the state board cannot consider and act on the item as agendized second as of the transmission time of this letter the court has not actually issued any judgment and irrespective of whether the timing of its issuance may be measured in days or weeks the court has not actually compelled the state board to take any action in fact the court today rejected the nvusds proposed form of judgment for technical reasons so there isnt even a form of judgment pending before the court what is important here is that the courts decision is not final until the judgment is entered and a writ issues it would be premature for the state board to take action in response to a judgment that has not actually been entered or a writ that has not issued and accordingly cde staffs recommendation to take action in anticipation of a judgment is inappropriate even if a judgment were entered after you receive this letter but before thursday morning which is highly unlikely in that the form was today rejected the state board is not bound to satisfy the judgments directives if the state board andor napa foundation appeal the judgment the judgment and writ of mandate directed to the state board are automatically stayed or held in abeyance upon the filing of a notice of appeal code of civil procedure section 916 when the state board meets in closed session this week we request the state board to authorize the filing of an appeal particularly given what is at stake for the state board ie to protect the authority vested in the state board by law to do what is right and necessary for california students when misguided local decisions fail to protect their interests in any event the napa foundation intends to appeal the judgments at its earliest opportunity given that at least napa foundation will be filing an appeal the state board should expect that any judgment will be stayed and should therefore not attempt to set aside the september 15 2022 action unless and until an appeal is resolved against the state board third even if there is no appeal the state board is under no legal obligation to set aside mayacamas charter at this juncture without reconsideration to the contrary if the state board sets aside its september 15 2022 decision the state board is obligated to reconsider approving mayacamas charter petition and may approve it again with a more detailed or even different rationale significantly the court did not in any way invalidate the state boards initial and threshold decision to hear napa foundations appeal under section 47605k2 which stands unaffected by the courts ruling that decision was based on cdes recommendation to hear the appeal in light of factual disputes in the documentary record that were appropriate for the state board to evaluate section 47605k2 provides that if the state board hears the appeal the state board may affirm the determination of the governing board of the school district or the county board of education or both of those determinations or may reverse only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion thus the state board may still choose to reverse the denial of the charter again following a hearing of the appeal and considering the courts rulings in the lawsuits but in any event it must eventually hear the appeal consistent with the state boards vote on september 15 2022 to do so the courts ruling was clear in that regard the court will not opine what further steps the state board must take if any or how the state board should exercise its discretioné a peremptory writ shall issue commanding respondent to take action specially enjoined by law in accordance with the courts ruling but nothing in the writ shall limit or control in any way the discretion legally vested in respondent this invites the state board to issue new andor revised findings for approval that account for the courts articulation of the appropriate standards for the state board to apply it invites the state board to address more specifically the abuses of discretion below eg through written findings that explain the state boards rationale for approving the charter in sufficient detail to satisfy the courts issues with the original approval these abuses of discretion were laid out in detail in napa foundations appeal to the state board napa foundation and its hundreds of parent student and teacher supporters are grateful for the state boards september 15 2022 decision approving the charter a decision the state board made in the best interests of california schoolchildren in recognition of the highly flawed denials below by the napa valley unified school district and napa county board of education the state board got it exactly right
0	please see the attached letter dear president darlinghammond as a parent in the san francisco unified school district and elected representative of the families in our city i want to express my concern about how the adoption of our states new mathematics framework could be interpreted by local school districts i appreciate the work our state board and instructional quality commission have done over the past two years to strike a balance between a traditional and integrated approach as well as a student needbased versus systemic approach as an elected leader i would not want to see a model as was adopted in san francisco be promoted at the state level removing student and parent choice to pursue an accelerated mathematics pathway is in conflict with californias values and leadership in the international stem industry i appreciate that the state boards framework does not promote this removal of choice but supports high quality and nextgeneration approaches to mathematics for our states students i understand the local control context of curriculum and textbook selection however i ask the state board to consider how the state can better support local education leaders in this foundational decision sincerely philip y ting assemblymember 19th district 
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting in the cmf the adopted california common core content standards are being replaced with big ideas aligned to 4 content connections which were not vetted shared with the ca public nor written by people with advanced math degrees the there is no evidence the big ideas will prepare our students for success in mathematics the sbe needs to require that a california math framework focus on the math content standards adopted by the state of california the proposed cmf will fail students especially struggling students as it shifts away from standardsbased instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards illdefined and vague big ideas which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered a california mathematics framework has the following goal this framework serves as a guide to implementing the california common core state standards for mathematics ca ccssm or the standards adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013 ch 1 line 37 yet only 63 of the cmf discusses or even lists specific ca math content standards 1072 lines out of 17088 lines the cmf has clearly failed to do its job in direct contrast to the job of a ca math framework the proposed cmf i ask you to reject recommends teaching big ideas as the content see evidence below who decided the big ideas should replace the content standards which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold phds in mathematics and which were vetted and voted on in california with public knowledge and input according to the cmf three individuals determined the big ideas for california and the cmf in chapter 3 line 244 and again in chapter 3 line 1468 we read three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 and three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following who are boaler munson and williams who apparently have the authority to determine what students in california will learn in math well of these three only 1 holds a degree in mathematics cathy williams has a bachelors in applied mathematics none of the three hold a master in mathematics and none of the three hold a phd in mathematics sbe you must reject a framework where big ideas created by nonmathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands if not california will fail to produce a stem workforce the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for stem careers additionally the cmf tells us these big ideas chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree are in fact just one interpretation of big ideas it should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics and those presented in these figures are one variation providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas ch 7 line 952 if this is the case and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards why doesnt the sbe put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in california why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students fate or allowing grade level teams who typically involve teachers without math degrees to decide what big ideas their students will learn this will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation furthermore in reading the cmf it is noted that the big ideas originated during distance learning so a focused set of big ideas indicated as big ideas was created as part of the california digital learning integration and standards guidance initiative cde 2021 these grade level big ideas organized by content connections and inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards are presented in the gradebanded chapters 6 7 and 8 ch 13 line 545 note the use of the phrase inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards why not all content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers evidence that the cmf wants to replace math content standards with their big ideas _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 6 line 228 _ the foundational mathematics contentñthat is the big ideas ch 6 line 942 _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 7 line 165 _ teachers should be teaching from big ideas not individual standards ch 10 line 177 _ educators of preservice teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authenticcontext bigideabased instruction described in this framework ch 10 line 247 so the big ideas proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past this replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design publishers teacher preparation programs and grading as well _ this framework reflects a revised approach advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas ch 1 line 405 _ to help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep active learning of mathematics for all students this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics

-1	do not adopt this framework the new framework for mathematics will set back california even further than before we need to go back to the framework of 2006 or similar it had high rigor and more importantly was successful in getting kids ready for college level mathematics and associated careers the new framework based upon the ideas and supposed research of a discredited educator from the uk who does not hold a degree in mathematics will harm our children irreparably please do the right thing and reject this new revised framework bring back the worldclass california standards and the 2006 framework instead it is vastly superior in all ways  
-1	my son has benefited from an accelerated math program at louis armstrong middle school in los angeles i do not understand why students like my son who have worked hard for three years to master standards ahead of schedule would be denied the opportunity to continue to do so under this proposed framework like many families in a similar situation well make the decision to vote with our feet and pursue private education for our child so that they can continue to fulfill their potential   
-1	oppose 
-1	both the premise for and the execution of this proposed new mathematics framework are fundamentally and irreparably flawed even if its adoption ended up successfully elevating students average math achievementwhich is not borne by the poorly documented and incorrectly analyzed evidence presentedits detrimental effect on the highest achievers will have far more damaging consequences for california and for the us the highest achieving students are almost universally the wellspring of the technological and entrepreneurial innovation that fuels our economy and our progress as a species holding back those students would be ethically and morally bankrupt and disastrously counterproductive for californias future furthermore any drive for homogeneity in education should be to elevate standards not lower them if the societal objective is to increase the diversity of students entering stem careers then handicapping californias students relative to the rest of the country and the world is exactly the opposite of what should be done to achieve that objective clearly this initiative to reduce mathematics educational standards to the lowest common denominator is not what it purports to be the pursuit of scientific integrity the advancement of californias and american competitive advancement in technology and the economy and the advancement of stem dei goals are all being irreparably harmed by this illconceived experiment the deleterious outcomes from adopting this framework are clearly evident at any level of scrutiny it is unclear what is more deeply concerning that the purveyors of this framework are unaware of those fully expected outcomes or that they are not unaware

-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses like algebra being an option in grade 8 and in fact studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments thankfully the sbe did not pass that version nor the second version of the cmf and this current third version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade algebra could be an option while progress has been made i ask you to again reject this cmf and require that clear pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations as the current cmf is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students the cmf clearly wants all students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ the cmf describes heterogeneously grouped classrooms from grade school through high school ch 1 line 208 _ the cmf notes possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade ch 8 line 702 and ch 8 line 1295 note that chapter 10 line 809 reads the framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight it is obvious that there are not clear recommendations within the cmf about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8 apparently some folks working on the cmf such as was evidenced in the first field review still want no acceleration before grade 11 but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9 this confusing unclear and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a cmf that the sbe adopts 1 _ as evidence for why the us should not allow acceleration before grade 11 the cmf states another review of international evidence about tracking found that while most organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly woessmann 2009 ch 9 line 148 first it is interesting to note that other countries who are far outperforming the us in math allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10 and yet the cmf is recommending waiting until grade 11 what is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration woessmann 2009 discusses students being tracked into different schools not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school there are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a lower school than there are with the current policy in california where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced english or history this is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics students recognize often as early as kindergarten that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others do not approve a california math framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to accelerate what does nonacceleration look like _ since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11 the cmf describes what grade 10 classes should look like we read when differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students the curriculum remains similar and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus ch 8 line 467 so advanced students 13 years ahead of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below proficient in grade 8 who is the teacher really going to teach if the teacher chooses the middle which is common the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into stem fields and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind there is one vignette in the cmf that explains how to support this type of

1	i support this revised ca framework because it was developed based on research on how kids brains work alongside research on how to create more inclusive learning environments this will allow us to move away from segregated math via math tracking that relies on standardized tests to place kids in math tracks they cant get out of this approach is much more equitable and will allow kids with different learning styles to also succeed i like that these framework revisions focus on teaching kids how math works so they have a stronger conceptual understanding of math i also appreciate that this framework includes culturally responsive tasks which moves away from teaching kids to memorize formulas but not necessarily understanding what they are doing  moving away from worksheets on worksheets of math facts to actual engaging learning thank you steve bartram teacher  
1	this supports how children learn best i am a retired special education teacher and support this adoption  
1	please pass item 11 adoption of 2023 mathematics framework  
1	as a former high school teacher i highly recommend adopting 11 
1	i support this measure because it teaches math based on concepts and techniques rather than memorization and a goal of passing a test   
1	i fully support this curriculum as retired school psychologist and special education teacher creating a curriculum that is both inclusive of diverse learning styles and considers the cultural differences is invaluable  
1	please see the attached support letter from the knowledge shop california has an opportunity to dramatically change the way it teaches math mathematics instruction in california can be more effective and equitable in many ca districts current teaching practices have resulted in only onethird of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures across the state additionally most students are being pushed out of highlevel pathways at a young age lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with outdated methods using narrow procedural questions this has had real consequences today less than half of california students satisfy ag requirements thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and careers california has insufficient educators qualified to work in stem it has to hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year math education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success preventing firstgeneration collegebound students black and latine students students with disabilities and lowincome immigrants from gaining entry to 4year colleges and universities and highpaying stem careers these programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which use standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude black students from gifted classrooms and relegate english learner students into lowlevel educational pathways at an early age these tests often given in elementary school have been used to sort and label students as those who are good at math and those who are not and often determine who and who are not college material the revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics _ students will be taught through rich engaging problems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections _ pathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take higherlevel math coursework _ a mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice students will be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve _ replacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into lowlevel remedial classes  with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more students 1  323 9036486 2723 w 54th street los angeles california 90043 schools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years based on extensive scientific evidence and have shown higher and more equitable outcomes because of the frameworks focus on opening pathways for students who have traditionally been excluded from higherlevel math instruction it has been the target of a wellfunded misinformation campaign for example organizations like the independent institute a darkmoney koch donor networkfunded organization cite complaints that align with other rightwing attacks on educational justice this rightwing think tank report makes unfounded claims deriding the framework for focusing on environmental and social justice traumainformed pedagogy and contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics rightwing pundits have perpetuated harmful narratives blaming racial and socioeconomic disparities in gifted and talented math instruction and poor math performance on students aptitude motivation and godgiven math ability these detractors argue for ineffective and outdated math practices and offer no solutions they promote parental fear by using dog whistles that equate innovative and equitable approaches to effective mathematics instruction with dumbing down the curriculum they repeat false talking points stating the ca mathematics framework mandates removing algebra from middle school instruction these statements are both inaccurate and untrue decades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for math instruction methods that are creative inclusive culturally responsive challenging and affirming for all students and that engage students more effectively strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning think critically and progress at their own pace the revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and five writers and has gone through a twoyear process of public comments and revisions as of april 2023 over 66 organizations and 2800 educators researchers and parents signed a letter of support for the california math framework 2  323 9036486 2723 w 54th street los angeles california 90043 they include _ the california county offices of education _ the california mathematics council _ the national council for teachers of mathematics nctm _ the national council for supervisors of mathematics ncsm _ just equations _ todos ð organization for excellence and equity in mathematics _ education trustwest _ center for equity for english learners at loyola marymount university _ california partnership for math and science education dont let outsiders money and political agendas determine the future of california and its children rightwing interests are investing millions of dollars to dismantle progress made by parents and educators working hard to make ca public schools more effective and equitable for all students and especially those who have historically been excluded in highlevel math instruction we see a similar backlash in the everincreasing attacks on inclusive education in other content areas such as teaching true history banning diverse books and targeting lgbtqinclusive practices these detractors offer no solutions and instead argue we should go back to an education system that has a demonstrated track record of failure for a majority of our students on july 1213th the ca school board will be taking up a longawaited decision to adopt a revised math framework add your name to the growing list of organizations and educators who are standing up for education equity the state board of education is encouraging public comment via this form on its website by 1200 noon on friday july 7 2023 click here to send an email sharing your

-1	i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting if the cmf vision is implemented our black and brown students will suffer the most it is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life and yet black or african american and brown latino or hispanic students in california are failing math at historic rates black or african american students are down to 16 proficient or advanced on caaspp in 202122 from their high of 21 in 2019 and latino or hispanic students are down to 21 proficient or advanced in 202122 from their high of 28 in 2019 ch 2 line 54 the majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students regardless of their skin color in mathematics this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards what does the cmf suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups does the cmf devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students unfortunately the cmf is instead focused on ensuring these students have authentic experiences and that teachers center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics ch 2 line 513 this is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer who thinks that will help everyone knows you get better at soccer and in our case math by learning and practicing rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of show to help them learn lets support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the caaspp  
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians

1	esteemed board members as a long time educator i am so pleased the california is looking forward to the future of our state by developing our future mathematicians the proposed framework empowers students to see math as relevant to their daily lives and useful in solving problems with the rise of ai our students need to see the application of math and develop the critical thinking skills to support themselves in their future careers all students need to see themselves as capable learners the interconnectedness of the big ideas in conjunction with the drivers of investigation content connections and math practices will create deeper richer math learning for our students i look forward to developing lessons and math units that utilize multiple standards and are connected to my students lives and interests it really opens up opportunities for students to see the connections of math and science computer science engineering and social studies the focus on equity and all students ability to learn is crucial for us to see success across all demographic subgroups all students need to receive the appropriate supports and the framework lays out some great strategies to allow our high students to soar and our low students to find success in math so many students get turned off by math because they feel like they are always failing the new framework helps develop students mathematical mindsets and provides opportunities for success via the multidimensional nature of mathematics i wholeheartedly support the framework and what it will do for our students please adopt it thank you lora carey educator in title 1 schools and districts for 10 years  
-1	following up on my prior comment the attached pdf document shows what was problematic about many of the citations in the sfr of the cmf i havent had time to scour the citations in the 2023 draft but i see that many of these issues are still outstanding other commenters have already pointed to some of them there is no room for any such misrepresentation in a document that will guide the mathematics education for all the public schools in our nations most populous state the fact that these false and misleading citations are driving stateissued guidelines is unacceptable and the framework needs to be rejected furthermore the frameworks recommendation pertaining to a data science high school course option are based on the course qualifying for area c of the university of californias ag requirements a status that the uc boars committee is meeting today to consider revoking in light of the fact that this revocation is potentially imminent it is foolish to adopt a flawed standard that wont even pass muster with the university of california and the california state university systems these courses have already been rejected as fulfilling the math requirements for csu schools it would be incredibly shortsighted to adopt a framework containing curricular recommendations that its own state college system has rejected supporters of the framework are hearing the good intentions and exercising their faith in the good will of the authors but they seem to be oblivious to these many issues issues which as a matter of procedure should have stopped this framework dead in its tracks long ago additional issues which i am echoing from other commenters  the cmf asserts with scant evidence that the solution the failings of californias public schools is to adopt the cmf writers preferred instructional approaches there is a large body of research and experience that indicates other approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve mathematics instruction  the lead writer of the cmf writing team had a conflict of interest because much of the research cited to support the authors claims particularly with regard to detracking as well as approaches recommended come from the organization she runs  youcubedorg this author earns substantial income consulting with ca public school districts advising on mathematics curricular changes and there is a fair likelihood that the state will approve textbooks that shes authored  a prohibited conflict of interest  if the instructional and policy recommendations in the cmf are followed by california school districts it is my informed opinion that california k12 students achievements in mathematics will continue to decline the first chapter of the cmf says it is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics connected to each other and to authentic real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs this focus on big ideas connection to authentic student contexts and vague notions of multidimensional ways rooted in udl will necessarily reduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills  
-1	the insertion of equity discussion does not belong in math class the cfcc shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the gradelevel chapters to support universal access and ensure access equity and inclusion for all students naep math scores have plunged in ca ca fails to include discussion of bringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the naep proves there is no provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math class as a discussion class on equity udl contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or math competency naep scores lowest in a decade where is the math proficiency component in the math framework ca needs research based strategies for achievement especially if minority groups are struggling with mathematics why are the asian students performing at higher levels research has shown that equitable strategies do not work ca needs to look at other state models where student achievement in math are much higher   
-1	we need more focus and energy on the objective math skills being learned or not by our children  
1	attached letter proposing a suggestion for appendix a there is still much work to be done on clarifying the pathways in high school mathematics to ensure that students have access to essential mathematics that prepares them for success in college or careers in ways that align with their goals and aspirations i support the current version as a starting point for these important ongoing discussions of how to improve mathematics outcomes for all students and encourage sbe to set up a task force or committee to develop a thoughtful strategic and empirical plan to improve high school math pathways the revised version of the 2023 mathematics framework for california schools is an improvement from previous versions i feel that section in pages 2  8 of appendix a is redundant and in some cases misaligned with the content presented in chapter 8 i do not think it helps clarify or serve a useful purpose i propose eliminating those pages and use the section key mathematical ideas to promote student success in introductory university courses in quantitative fields as the entirety of the appendix there is still much work to be done on clarifying the pathways in high school mathematics to ensure that students have access to essential mathematics that prepares them for success in college or careers in ways that align with their goals and aspirations i support the current version as a starting point for these important ongoing discussions of how to improve mathematics outcomes for all students and encourage sbe to set up a taskforce or committee to develop a thoughtful strategic and empirical plan to improve high school math pathways patrick callahan

-1	my experiences are those as a mother 8 years reading uc berkeley freshman applications and 15 years advising college applicants my educational background is stanford human biology major johns hopkins ma and uc berkeley mba having had 2 sons in stanfords epgy educational program for gifted youth math program i strongly disagree with the proposed california math framework cmf i also have a son with a learning disability so i understand that side of education the epgy program was based on the best math programs from around the world epgy allowed a mathgifted son to wrap up most engineeringrequired math courses by the end of high school hs why not adapt the epgy pedagogy for the cmf i am commenting because i believe that the proposed cmf is being determined by those who fear math that a female ms boaler supports a cmf that begins algebra i in 9th grade makes me wonder whether the premise is equity or a cultural convention of females fearing math about a decade ago at a stanford class reunion a workshop showed female math sat curves shifted to the left of similarly shaped male sat curves if asian females are prepped by telling them that asians do well in math their sat curves showed no difference from male curves perhaps the problem is finding good math teachers flipped classrooms may be the solution assign khan academy videos as homework and use math class periods as guided practice ive heard of data science as an algebra 2 option but that can reduce admission eligibility to other us colleges that dont recognize that equivalence algebra 2 is also a prerequisite for statistics courses required by todays majors including social sciences what my gifted sons did is typical of top students seen in uc berkeley applications completing algebra i and geometry in middle school allows calculus before hs graduation required for admission to caltech harvey mudd and many business majors the proposed cmf makes hs calculus impossible unless a student doubles up on math courses the proposed cmf actually reduces equity in that wellinformed students could find ways to get extra math courses in short all my experiences say that beginning algebra i in 9th grade retards development of math gifted students and destroys eligibility for meeting college math requirements going into the brave new world of ai reminds me of how it was after sputnik the proposed cmf doesnt seem to recognize these realities and should be trashed this reminds me of when my sons were to learn wholeword reading instead of phonics a generation of kids didnt learn to read there is a fundamental mathscience pathway but instead of watereddown ag math courses an innovative math pedagogy would also support business and handson careers the beauty of math can be seen in the traditional path an alternative path could show that figures dont lie but liars figure meanwhile the rest of the world supplies immigrants who fill us tech jobs  
-1	i appose item 11 our children deserve better than to be dragged into a radical political agenda we need to keep aspiring to excellence for them rather than dumbing down their subjects especially math makes no sense for those that need extra help theres provision for those who are excelling lets keep challenging them  
-1	it is awful 
-1	i am opposing the 2023 math framework for california public schools because it is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math math is a hard subject that needs to be learned with rigor and a lot practices as well the focus should be adopting the right teaching methods and providing positive feedback to the kids who really put in the efforts to learn we could lower all the testing criteria to make everyone feeling good about an inflated evaluation of their math capability but that will not change the fact they are still lacking in understanding the real math and cannot solve the real problems in life this simply sets them up to face bigger frustrations and failures down the road we should make students feel positive about math by teaching them proper math and enabling them to gain satisfaction from solving real challenging problems step by step often times i hear from kids that they get bored and disengaged in the classroomsschool if they are not getting the right challenges in learning  
1	i enjoyed my math classes as a child more when they were more engaging and handson tailored towards the interests and needs of those who had less interest in math initially i support continuing to make math accessible and engaging  
0	hello please see attached comments from the lcff equity coalition on items 2 3 4 11 and 12 of next weeks sbe agenda please let me know if you have any questions about our comments thanks so much ines rosales public advocates  
-1	i am opposing this 2023 math framework for california public schools because its lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors we need more people to succeed in the stem majors to push forward the innovations that have been propelling the technology advancement that contributed to a few most profound changes in the human history holding back students who are capable is detrimental to preparing our next generation to be able to take up the new challenges and in the near term will reduce their chance to continue into good colleges in stem majors or result in more likelihood for them to fail in college kids who are academically strong should be provided a good development path in public schools just like kids who are strong in sports or arts otherwise this would cause the inequality opportunity issue for socioeconomically disadvantaged kids in academics advancement  
1	date july 7th 2023 subject public comment in support of californias mathematics framework dear california department of education i am writing to provide my support for the proposed mathematics framework for california as an educator and advocate for quality mathematics education i commend the department for its dedication to developing a comprehensive framework that aligns with researchbased practices and addresses the needs of all students i would like to express my enthusiasm for the emphasis on mathematical thinking problemsolving and reasoning throughout the framework these skills are crucial for students to develop a deep understanding of mathematics and apply their knowledge to realworld situations by promoting these skills the mathematics framework will empower students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners chapter 5 stands out as a significant advancement in mathematics education as it specifically addresses the importance of data science skills for students in the modern era the progressions outlined in this chapter provide clear and ageappropriate learning pathways enabling students to develop a strong foundation in data literacy and engage in meaningful applications of mathematics to realworld scenarios i would also like to express my appreciation for the frameworks effort to clarify various terms used throughout the document the definitions and explanations provided for mathematical concepts and processes are thorough and beneficial for educators and students alike however i would like to recommend that the term data cleaning be included in the glossary or further elaborated within the framework clarifying this term will ensure a shared understanding among educators and students as data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science process while the framework effectively connected mathematics with computer science standards i believe there is an opportunity to establish additional connections with other disciplines mathematics has inherent ties with science technology engineering and the arts by emphasizing interdisciplinary connections and providing guidance on integrating mathematics with these disciplines the framework can foster a holistic and wellrounded education showcasing the interconnectedness of mathematics with various fields of study i appreciate the mention of specific tools that support data analysis and visualization in the framework however i would like to underscore the importance of incorporating commonly used programming languages into data science education proficiency in programming languages like python and r has become increasingly vital in the field of data science by prioritizing the inclusion of these programming languages in the framework students will develop practical skills that align with industry demands better preparing them for future careers and academic pursuits i would like to emphasize the alignment between the skills presented in the mathematics framework for california and the data skills assessed in the national assessment of educational progress naep the naep data from 2011 to 2022 reveals a decline in average scores and achievement levels in mathematics for california with an average scale score change of 6 and a grade level loss of 05 by incorporating data science concepts and emphasizing data literacy in the mathematics curriculum as outlined in the framework california can address this decline and equip students with the necessary skills to succeed in mathematics and beyond the inclusion of data analysis interpretation and problemsolving skills will empower students to navigate the increasingly datadriven world supporting their academic and career readiness in addition i would like to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of data science education in other states across the country for instance virginia has taken a significant step by creating and approving standalone data science standards acknowledging the unique skill set required to navigate and analyze data effectively similarly utah is actively conducting a pilot program that includes standalone data science courses accompanied by cohorts of professional development for teachers these initiatives along with the widespread adoption of the data science course code created by the national center for education statistics nces and the national school courses for the exchange of data sced demonstrate the increasing nationwide recognition of the need to equip students with data science skills almost half of the country has either implemented the sced data science course code or developed their own data science course codes by incorporating data science concepts into the mathematics framework for california the state can join these leading efforts and ensure that its students are prepared for the datadriven world they will encounter in their academic and professional lives this alignment with national trends will enable california students to develop the necessary tools to thrive in the datadriven world remain competitive in an evolving job market and contribute to the innovation and growth of the state thank you for considering my testimony i want to express my deep appreciation for the mathematics framework for california and emphasize how much i value it as an exceptional tool for teachers the framework provides comprehensive guidance and innovative strategies that empower educators to deliver engaging instruction fostering critical thinking problemsolving and data literacy skills among their students by equipping teachers with the necessary resources and support the framework ensures that students receive a highquality mathematics education that prepares them for success in the 21st century i firmly believe that the implementation of the mathematics framework will have a positive and transformative impact on mathematics education in california should you require any further information or have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me i eagerly anticipate the implementation of the mathematics framework and the incredible benefits it will bring to both teachers and students in california sincerely samantha leav director of state policy data science 4 everyone sleavuchicagoedu dear california department of education i am writing to provide my support for the proposed mathematics framework for california as an educator and advocate for quality mathematics education i commend the department for its dedication to developing a comprehensive framework

-1	this framework has an inadequate focus on the evaluation and goal of math proficiency math builds on itself so that without assuring mastery of each topic students are unprepared thus proficiency must be the goal not just enhancing learning or positive mathematics identities standardized tests are most effective at evaluating proficiency  to supplement these tests some measures allow for after the formal assessment on can test limits deviating from standard procedures gathering qualitative observations such as those described as formative assessment there is an entire chapter of over 60 pages on assessment and no where is there a mention of modern test standards that are based on rigorous psychometric data including norms reliability and validity testing  specifically no where is there any reference to the term test validity the concept that assessments must have some evidence that they measure the underlying concept they purport to measure  for example one would expect a score on a test of advanced placement calculus to predict whether students could solve calculus problems in different college level tests or for their score on the test to be related to their grade in the class  there is also no reference to reliability egscores are not random so that if students take a test twice their scores should be roughly comparable as measured by a reliability coefficient a correlation between scores across students   to have these essential features requires the use of standardized tests such as the caasp and mdtp there is a discussion of giving students feedback on their assessment which is laudable however to the extent that feedback is vague and unreliable rather than providing refined information on subskill mastery using measures that meet the rigorous psychometric standards of the national center of intensive intervention ncii it is useless nweamap would give far more granular detail about subskill mastery refer to the  for further discussion if a goal of the framework is to increase math ability there is no discussion of using evidencebased norms to compare whether students are falling behind expected rates of improvement  here are the ethical standards for educational testing that are freely downloadable and which must be adhered to for ethical assessment    this refers to psychological testing standards   allyson c rosen phd abpp board certified in clinical neuropsychology director of dementia education sierrapacific mental illness research education and clinical center mirecc va palo alto health care system stanford alzheimers disease research center clinical associate professor affiliated department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences stanford university school of medicine   submit to ethics review in the journal of alzheimers disease

-1	this is regarding the new math framework i am a mom of 2 kids one is in middle school and another going to college this fall as if now older one is pursuing a stem degree he took accelerated math classes enjoyed them and did fairly well he wouldnt have gotten into his dream college if he wouldve not got the chance to take these classes my younger one a girl is showing keen interest in the same direction gone through the college admission process and high school for the older one i am beyond scared and disappointed and angry if the board decides on curbing the accelerated math classes every kid is different  please let the parents teachers and kids decide what they want to do as you cant force everyone to take accelerated classes similarly you have no right to take away accelerated classes from kids who can and want to pursue this path us needs more of stem graduates not less which would be very hard to nurture and produce if you decide to go on this path  
-1	it is insanely racist for you all to propose this the idea that students of color arent intelligent enough to meet higher standard is beyond words do better  
-1	please remove jo boaler from the committee involved in writing the california math framework please do not approve the framework as written it must be rewritten with a new commonsense voice boaler fabricates data to suit her hypothesis and is highly unscientific untold children will materially be set back in a global marketplace if you proceed as is the professional and academic world will view the approval of this math framework harshly if you dont turn back 
-1	dear cde sbe and iqc i write to implore you not to rush the adoption of the cmf  if the rumors are true and the next version will go from more than 900 pages to a comparably trim 600 pages the public has a vested interest in being allowed the opportunity to review such a vast revision and provide further comment before the cmf is summarily adopted please do not hastily approve a third draft of the cmf without allowing the public and those that have invested so much time already into the careful consideration or in the case of brian conrad dissectionevisceration of the cmf with all of its merits ideas errors and flaws please do not let this cmf go down in infamy as the time when the state board inadvertently canonized something that will come to be ridiculed as the balanced literacy version of math instruction  please take a lesson from all of the science of reading zeitgeist and dont let this happen to math education in ca a concerned parent henry whynot  
-1	i am opposing this new math framework for california public schools because math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians apparently the real experts mathematicians in the subject domain were not consulted enough or did not participate in defining this framework which is not acceptable math and other stem related subjects need to be learned with precision and followed with rigor for the students to be able to master it which is a major goal of education   
-1	it is hard to disagree with some of the sentiments behind the cmf like the ideas that all children should be given the chance to succeed in mathematics and children from some groups have had systemic obstacles to success but there is a logical leap from these worthy points to the cmfs recommended interventions like detracking while all children have potential anyone who has taken a math class or works in a technical field knows that there is also such a thing as innate mathematical ability and it is not equally distributed in the population eliminating advanced classes tracking and selection tests removes the ability to assign children to material appropriate to their ability and current proficiency and especially harms the highest achieving kids who are no longer challenged and stimulated in class much of the research that the cmf is based on and cites has weak quality for instance the nonpeer reviewed paper raising expectations and achievement the impact of two wide scale detracking mathematics reforms by boaler and foster study 2 claims a benefit from an intervention in test scores by comparing scores on various tests in the preimplementation year to a different test in the implementation year which makes no sense statistically by contrast the most rigorous study of tracking a randomized controlled trial led by esther duflo who later won the nobel prize found a benefit to tracking among both the low and highachieving children peer effects teacher incentives and the impact of tracking evidence from a randomized evaluation in kenya  
1	math was one of the skills that came really naturally to me when i was younger but as i grew up and my natural abilities started to no longer be enough to get by i found that i had failed to learn how to properly study math and now struggle with it my hope in supporting this proposal is that these changes can help make math not only accessible but help lay foundations for all the students to come   
1	1chapter 8 needs revision to show that the two pathways through the high school curriculum are alternative sequences through the same content stipulated in the california standards the current draft gives the impression that the content differs substantially in the standards and therefore in chapter 8 functions and modeling with functions should be in the foreground for both pathways the study of functions and their use to model real world phenomena is foundational for calculus and for data science it is also a more intuitive and motivating path to more advanced mathematics for students from varied backgrounds with varied aspirations 2appendix a pages 2 through 8 should be deleted or rewritten to align with the content in chapter 8 i recommend deletion because it is redundant with chapter 8   
1	my son deserves a 21stcentury math education it should be based on pedagogy that creates equitable learning environments hes 3 years from starting please adopt this framework   
1	i fully support adoptions to the california framework in mathematics the students at our school will benefit from updated inclusive and differentiated instruction to support their academic success in mathematics thank you for letting me voice the needs of my students  
1	i support the changes to the california mathematics framework our students and children need to learn mathematics in creative open ways including data science data science is one of the fastest growing fields in the world and seniors are graduating with little to no knowledge of data literacy and therefore are entering the workforce unprepared also teaching ideas that are broken down into the tiniest pieces like solving 1 step equations solving 2 step equations etc students dont understand how ideas and concepts are connected a focus on big ideas is a great way to make more connections with concepts and allow students to retain information for longer  
1	i was an honors student in high school i am now in college i would have been better for me to have more hs math options   
1	i support these changes they are in line with teaching mathematics in a way that involves investigation and allows for multi levels and personal growth students need math to be taught in a way the encompasses a wide range of processes as well as the understanding that math ideas are interconnected   
1	i fully support the changes to the mathematical frameworks as students will benefit by the methods suggested  
1	i was an honors student in high school i am now in college i would have been better for me to have more hs math options   
1	i support the framework and these changes which will help all students in ca i have taught at a college level and believe these changes will prepare more students for college mathematics  
1	i support the framework changes as they will help make mathematics more accessible to students   
-1	our black and brown students will be poorly served by the cmf framework i want all children to grow up competent and confident in their knowledge and application of mathematics the cmf will set them back  
1	this framework is necessary to have equitable mathematics for all we need pathways in high school and research based practices in elementary school   
-1	dear california sbe i oppose the current draft of the cmf i believe that every child deserves to receive the best mathematics education possible i believe that is justice to fail to do this is an injustice reducing proficiency in mathematics doesnt help anyone use the social sciences to address social injustice dont use math instruction for this dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability standards, learning teaching and assessment as its primary focus

-1	see attachment jelani nelson professor department of electrical engineering and computer sciences uc berkeley the most recent draft as well as previous drafts of the california math framework cmf state that the purpose of the cmf is to support implementation of the california common core state standards for mathematics ca ccssm though the mic pathway has been eliminated in this most recent draft the cmf draft still continues to advocate for high school data science courses as alternatives to algebra ii or math iii discussion of yesenia ch 8 lines 793794 contrary to the standards for college readiness as defined the ca ccssm our official state standards for k12 mathematics to quote the ca ccssm pg 58 the higher mathematics standards specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready the model pathways defining what higher mathematics standards are meant is at the top of the same page ie either the traditional pathway algebra i geometry algebra ii or the integrated pathway math iiiiii our states standards are clear and the purpose of the cmf in its own language is to support implementation of those standards any student wishing to go to college to be college ready should acquire the competencies provided by completion of one of those pathways including yesenia from ch 8 lines 793794 the aspiring political scientist the concept of a high school data science course is amorphous with no standards and with each data science course having different learning goals than any other for example the author of the most popular high school data science course in our state uclas introduction to data science ids has stated that his course contains just a dash of mathematical thinking and indeed ids own materials confirm that it does not cover any nonstatistics standards from algebra ii the current cmf draft currently justifies its treatment of data science as third year mathematics by pointing at recent updates to area c policy by the university of california ch 8 pgs 3435 allowing high school data science courses to be taken in place of algebra ii however in march 2023 the california state systemwide committee on academic preparation and education programs approved a formal resolution expressing frustration with the university of california system for approving high school data science courses that do not meet state standards an article published just yesterday in the chronicle of higher education by stephanie lee shows that at the uc entire departments and in some cases even academic senate leadership for entire uc campuses have penned letters urging the uc to reverse this policy which is also binding for the cal state system thus it is in my opinion highly likely that the uc will in the near future reverse this policy making the cmf recommendations on high school data science out of sync with all of the states public universities almost immediately i thus urge the state board of education to either remove all mentions of high school data science or to postpone a vote on the issue until after the university of california makes a final determination as to whether it will keep its current high school data science policy as is

-1	i am an 18yearold san franciscan who is planning on majoring in mathematics in college ideally any student who desires to will be able to progress through math at their maximum possible pace without reaching a maximum class singlevariable calculus and statistics are currently framed as the highest goals of high school mathematics intelligent teenagers can and should take such classes as linear algebra multivariable calculus and ordinary differential equations i attended a private high school for gifted students where these three classes are considered part of the extended math core and are highly popular in order to have time to complete such courses students should be allowed to take more basic classes early andor at an accelerated pace i agree that students who specialize in mathematics may also understand that vectors and matrices are additional objects that can name new types of quantities and can be manipulated to understand those quantities using operations similar but not identical to those of real numbers therefore a class on linear algebra should be offered the truth is that the goal of withinclassroom intellectual diversity comes at the cost of intellectual diversity as a whole when students are grouped by ability gifted students achieve greater outcomes at no cost to less gifted students card and giuliano 2015 write that advanced black and hispanic students gain 05 standard deviation units in fourthgrade reading and math scores with persistent gains through sixth grade when tracking is implemented in fourth grade and that they found no evidence of either positive or negative spillover effects on other students in the same schoolgrade cohort a result echoed in many other studies this is desirable because it increases the overall amount of achievement the framework states that students who failed eighthgrade algebra and thus took the algebra cst again at the end of their ninthgrade year scored lower on average than students who took the algebra cst for the first time at the end of ninth grade this is simply due to a selection effect on page 7 of the chapter on middle school it is unclear how some students will bring experiences perspectives and ideas that enrich the classroom for all in the context of math class math is not related to life experiences other than very basic ones which are crosscultural the only experiences perspectives and ideas that are useful in math class are ones which come from previous creative or quick mathematical thinking as simple diagnostic criteria has proven more accurate than subjective clinical judgements there should be a systematized and accessible process for students to be placed into whatever math class matches their knowledge all students should be offered an algebra i or mathematics i course in eighth grade so that students from any background even students in traditionally lowperforming school districts can have a chance to complete advanced math courses in college i agree that schools should adjust the high school curriculum instead eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses so that students do not need four courses before calculus or at least offer a compressed pathway as an option however providing both early algebra and high school course compression are desirable because calculus is not the most advanced math class that highperforming students should be taking i agree that if students take another thirdyear course besides mathematics iii or algebra ii they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking calculus in high school or in their first semester of college and i am glad that the pathway for data science rather than algebra ii has been discarded students taking a mathematical science degree will be expected to know calculus the statement that most collegelevel study in mathematics will expect considerable familiarity and comfort with manipulating algebraic expressions and equations and modeling with functions in order to solve problems and make certain features of functions apparent is a considerable understatement in chapter 1 there is a discussion of rigor the provided definition is an integrated way in which conceptual understanding strategies for problemsolving and computation and applications are learned so that each supports the other i understand that the definition was knowingly altered to provide a simple reference term to refer to a core concept of the framework however rigor is already a word and its true definition is related to strictness and stiffness it is not about subjective understanding but about the unassailability of the logic neither does it have to do with strategies and neither does it necessarily involve any applications whatsoever of course subjective understanding useful strategies and interesting applications are all necessary for mathematical pedagogy but it is unclear why they have been here included under rigor in fact i am of the belief that logical rigor should be taught in school if students learn how to read and write real proofs then they will not only be introduced to higher math but they will also learn valuable lessons about critical thinking and argument on page 7 of the chapter on data science it is stated that understanding of linear regression is closely related to understanding of functions and polynomials in fact the concept of minimization of error which is essential to the understanding of linear regression is a concept from calculus as the framework states a data science degree requires calculus and linear algebra these subjects are essential to the topic just as geometry is essential to the understanding of calculus then if the school system wishes to prepare students for statistical understanding it should prioritize teaching students calculus and linear algebra if possible as soon as possible much of the framework aspires to the effective use of visualization and computational tools with preloaded formulas the productive use of such tools is certainly important but it is not mathematics the practice of formulating questions to be answered with data is in the purview of

-1	what a missed opportunity although i can tell the document has been revised i do not see how this framework will make an effective change to teaching practice any attempt to distill this document down will lead to misapplications and mythbased instruction although there is little use in playing what if what would have happened if the committee had instead focused on how to implement research practices that improve achievement in an engaging way instead of focusing solely on uplifting inquiry as the only way to ensure active engagement what if the cmf had been aligned with the ies practice guides for teaching mathematics and provided teachers with evidencebased instructional strategies and ways to implement them engagingly although the common core standards and smps are indisputably important and useful ideas the lack of a distilled set of instructional principles other than telling teachers to always use rich authentic tasks and center everything around student ideas that teachers can put into practice is frustrating based on this revision it seems inevitable that the impression that throwing students into authentic tasks is all that is needed for students to be engaged and learn and that because standards are assigned to a grade band no one teacher is responsible for ensuring students reach mastery on a concept skill or procedure this frankly is a recipe for continuous unfinished learning that is passed from grade to grade in addition adopting the definition of fluency that removes the explicit final goal of retrieval from memory is setting up kids for difficulties and the very anxiety in higher mathematics that the cfm is attempting to avoid there is no question that the push to memorize procedures without ever teaching concepts was wrong but the push to eliminate memorization ð or at least downplay its importance to the extent you see it minimally mentioned only in an offhand way  is equally problematic although i appreciate the revisions that have so far been made i do not believe this document is ready for release and frankly there has hardly been any time at all to read and comment on this version others like brian conrad have pointed out continued misleading citations to research and i am continually dismayed by the focus on inquiry as the primary method of teaching as well as the continued denigration of any explicit systematic instruction as passive and lecture and lowerlevel teaching instead they set up a false dichotomy between engagement and explicit instruction and so it is no wonder the authors want the assessment processes to change based on prior research on the impact of inquiry on achievement the results of this frameworks implementations are not likely to be good

-1	the cde and sbe created a clever set up that creates the appearance of opening up the cmf for public comments while in practice it effectively runs the general public out of time to provide feedback the current version of the cmf that the sbe is about to vote on retained and carried over several substantive flaws from the prior cfmsecond field draft these must be corrected furthermore cmf has been written under a process fraught with conflicts of interest the cde and sbe should hire external legal counsel to evaluate this issue to provide clearance and not rely on its internal counsel that is biased to support internal processes the current cmf cannot be approved in its current form and be allowed to influence math public education for 8 years the sbe should be up to date on current issues and perform its due diligence that incorporates research and practical evidence that clearly illustrates that the current proposals in cmf do not work for example cmf references in lines 833836 chapter 8 that data science is valid due to a uc boars policy resolution on area c october 2020 recently california state university passed an academic senate resolution rejecting the uc policy page 4 third full paragraph in the attached csu 3599pdf public education in the state of california is funded by both state and federal funding the cde effectively hired cmf writers employed by the owner of youcubed trademark ðstanford universitys graduate school of education gse department  that sell teacher training into public schools on data science courses to write a data science philosophy into the math framework where funding for public education is coming both from state and federal resources organizational conflicts of interest oci in federal contracts requires that contractors who advise on establishing criteria should not be writing their own criteria into policies such that they can then turn around and sell their services funded by taxpayer funds yet the cde and sbe did exactly that it has been made crystal clear by 442 california based stem professors attached exclusively from 4 year colleges including 100 stanford stem professors not part of stanfords graduate school of education department that these shallow data science courses do not adhere to mathematical content standards and that data science is not a replacement for algebra ii dr jelani nelson from uc berkeley and dr brian conrad from stanford are high profile advocates of the fact that there should be a content standard established for data science what criteria should be used for instructional materials the cde and sbe have made no efforts to establish objective criteria instead a select group of collaborators from ucla and stanfords gse during the cmf revision process over the last 3 years have been given a huge advantage over any competition see attached emails education policy at the state level should be based on unbiased academic research enclosure 94 page document  
1	to members of the state board of education i support the adoption of the ca mathematics framework 2023 the framework focuses on  integrated and conceptual understanding the framework promotes an integrated and conceptual understanding of mathematics rather than focusing solely on procedural fluency it encourages students to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and connections between different mathematical topics this approach helps students develop a solid foundation in math and fosters a lifelong love for the subject problemsolving and application the revised framework encourages students to engage in problemsolving activities and apply their mathematical knowledge to realworld situations teachers families and partners support this aspect as it helps students see the relevance of math in their everyday lives and equips them with problemsolving skills that are valuable beyond the classroom collaboration and communication the framework emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication in learning mathematics it encourages students to work in groups engage in mathematical discourse and explain their thinking this collaborative approach fosters a supportive and inclusive learning environment and prepares students for future teamwork and communication in various settings respectfully alvin salgarino middle school math teacher   
-1	dear ca sbe these current version of the cmf appears to be a large scale experiment i recognize that some experimentation in teaching methods is helpful and appropriate but this is to grans a scale the human brain is quite capable of memorization removing the need for memorization is not helping our students or our society

-1	why would we prevent students from achieving their utmost by studying math topics that they are ready for when they are ready for them students with fewer outside resources will be at an unfortunate disadvantage if algebra is not permitted before 9th grade as they are the ones who will not be as able to pursue the subject independently dont accidentally make the math achievement gap wider   
1	i support the new revised ca mathematics framework this much anticipated document is essential to the work of counties districts sites and additional support providers as they work to support educators and all students to be successful in tk12 mathematics mathematics can and has been a gatekeeper for students especially those from marginalized communities and therefore a document like this provides research proven suggestions that will support teachers from multiple directions including how to teach with big ideas teaching with a lens of social justice and suggested secondary pathways that are more equitable for all students i strongly encourage the state board of education to adopt and accept the revised mathematics framework  
-1	this framework is heavy on dei and fails the goal of actually teaching math  since when did math become a political subject stop messing with our childrens future with this ideology look at statescountries that actually have success in teaching math my recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful ð like those in massachusetts utah idaho and china for starters   
-1	dear state board of education i am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposed mathematics framework for california public schools and the very short period being provided for public comment on this version of the framework regarding the comment time i understand the public is being given less than 2 weeks to comment with a deadline of noon todaya deadline im barely meeting even as someone who has done a lot of publicschool advocacy the last few years given the short time frame and scheduling of comments during the 4th of july holiday period it seems likely that many people who would be interested in commenting on such a major proposal wont even know about it in time the cde website states that 60day review periods were provided for comment on prior versions of the proposal  so why not provide a similar time frame for review and comment on the latest version regarding the substance of the math framework i am concerned that it is based largely on ideological and personal views about teaching math and equity rather than on evidencebased practices and realworld behavior as a parent of two kids in sfusd we have seen that efforts grounded in ideology however wellintentioned have had harmful results including in math just because you want something to be true doesnt make it so for example about 10 years ago sfusd noting gaps between groups and the need for equity embarked on an ambitious plan to change how math is taught including by removing algebra from 8th grade the results of this experiment it was a failure as sfusds superintendent matt wayne has publicly acknowledged indeed the gaps between groups grew even worse many families with more resources put their kids in private school or found workarounds such as tutoring and online classes to help their kids in math and the most disadvantaged kids got the short end of the stick yet again with even less opportunity to learn to be challenged and to excel what you dowhat we choose to do as a societyaffects real people i am very concerned by the frameworks apparent reliance on many of dr jo boalers recommendations as sfusds math overhaul was strongly influenced by dr boalers viewsand failed i urge you to rely on evidencebased practicesthe things we know work bestnot onesizefitsall policies and approaches we need to try to meet each child where they are at and give them the opportunity to succeed we are all different we all have different strengths and weaknesses and we can all benefit from being challengedwherever we may be starting from thank you for considering my comments sincerely supryia ray  
-1	i am writing today as a san francisco public school parent who strongly opposes rushing through changes to the ca math framework similar changes made to sfusds math framework have left students behind and unprepared for college dumbing down and singletracking math does not result in better outcomes for lowincome students are students of color it harms everyone also failing to focus math frameworks on math not side issues like equity and the environment means that students will learn less math we must prepare our students for whatever comes next for them and that means building a strong mathematics foundation for every child once they have strong foundations in math only then can students apply math more broadly in other areas you have rushed through a bad plan and i am asking you to slow down and give time for evaluation and meaningful comment our kids deserve that thank you meg kammerud san francisco

-1	dear california sbe i urge you to reject this draft of the cmf because it doesnt provide a sufficient means for those students that are exceptionally talented in mathematics to pursue an accelerated path helping those that struggle with mathematics should not result in removing opportunities for those that excel in mathematics  
1	as a current mathematics teacher in ca public schools and a former student in the ca public education system i am writing to express my support for the proposed california math framework the framework provides appropriate guidance for districts schools and teachers to implement the common core standards for mathematics placing a focus on diversity equity and deep understanding of mathematics i am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework and would like to speak to a few of these criticisms and why i believe they should be taken with a grain of salt when considering the goals for the future of california mathematics education firstly many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by brian conrad of the stanford mathematics department i attended stanford university as an undergraduate in the late 2010s during my time at stanford conrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies unfortunately my experience with mathematics at stanford revealed that the stanford math department has no interest in increasing diversity equity or deep understanding of mathematics i entered my freshman year as a high achieving math student excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major but my first day of class made me feel alienated incompetent and discouraged not because i was truly unqualified but because the professor made it clear that asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity that he expected the majority of us to fail the class and that mathematics was an elite field meant only for some throughout my first year i learned more about the math department that only supported these initial impressions  particularly that there were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color and that the department building had only recently installed its first womens restroom i chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that i could continue exploring advanced mathematical ideas but apart from the mathematics department i still maintain that had i attended a different university i would have likely majored in mathematics but stanford was not a welcoming place to do so i bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though brian conrad may have interest in the subject he has little to no authority to speak on mathematics education and within his own field of influence he has been a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the ca math framework i am sure that we do not want ca students to feel alienated incompetent and discouraged when experiencing math class and i feel that the math framework would allow us to move in a positive direction another criticism of the framework relates to the frameworks advice on limiting tracking and acceleration in mathematics as both a teacher and mathematics student who experienced acceleration i can speak to the extreme negative effects it can have not only creating significant gaps in understanding but also causing students to burn out on math instead of fostering a love and joy that can last throughout college and career specifically some criticisms argue that advice against acceleration are holding students back and that prior to common core all students used to take algebra in 8th grade but now that is pushed to high school i personally took algebra in 8th grade under the standards preceding common core and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under common core matches up with what was taught in algebra by contrast the high school algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires much deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was previously accepted it is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring students have strong interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics  this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration because of this i appreciate the frameworks advice on limiting acceleration and i am hopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that prioritize students deep understanding i am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the mathematics framework over the past 3 years i urge the board to adopt the framework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for ca math students   
0	stephanie lees recent article in the chronicle of higher education at   exposes the corruption and major flaws in the october 2020 uc policy change on area c and the strong opposition to it from across the entire uc and csu faculty with actual content expertise in quantitative disciplines the cmf must not under any circumstances refer to that policy or else the sbe risks being a party to future lawsuits filed against all who are responsible for promoting such educational malpractice   
1	dear state of california board members thank you for your thorough review of the revised draft of the proposed california mathematics framework as a parent of two children in the k12 system seeing what they bring home for their math assignments hearing the way they talk about math class and looking at their achievement on the caaspp i agree that there must be a change to the way mathematics is taught i appreciate the focus on looking at the big picture and emphasis on using rich tasks from which to teach i appreciate that there is a place for students to excel but also to realize the relevance of mathematics i support the adoption of the this proposed framework sincerely melanie janzen  
1	please move forward with this adoption of the frameworks california schools are in need of these guideposts that bring access and opportunity to all students with a mindset that all students can learn math at high levels please vote to support this adoption and allow schools and districts to move forward   
-1	dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability students are grouped together see chapter nine or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableñas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived ability so that students soon understand who is the high kid and who is the low kid in the group aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns randomizing group assignments can convey
-1	dear california sbe i believe our civilization is better off with a population that has a solid foundation in mathematics the current cmf focus on big ideas aligned to 4 content connections which are not embraced by the public nor written by mathematicians this does not serve our students our state our nation our world i would like the sbe to reject this cmf and return to the 2012 ca math framework  
-1	i am a native californian and a product of the public school and university system my wife and i have three kids and live in san francisco our two older kids go to public school the math policy of sfusd is an abject failure we should be ashamed of ourselves for making it worse i strongly oppose californias proposed math curriculum framework please bring back rigor and challenge including algebra for 8th graders thank you  
0	hello i am writing in concern with the lack of research with in the new k12 mathematical framework i agree with my colleague that it appeares as if only jo boalers research was included although boalers books have provided some work that can work and some that do not what about research from   my colleague was unable to find anything in our new framework more research must be done not just one person s research please consider putting off the adoption until additional research of good mathematical practices can be included thank you vicky teel  
-1	i oppose immediate adoption of the ca math framework because version 3 was made public only last monday releasing it in the middle of the summer makes it virtually impossible for teachers parents students district administrators and other stakeholders to provide their views acquisition of math skills is essential for california kids to be able to compete for stem jobs and futures providing more education training and support is a better route for all children than delaying algebra to 9th grade please spend the time to seek and obtain input on version 3 thank you

1	i strongly urge the state board of education to formally adopt the revised math framework as shared on its website it is essential that california lead the way in rejecting the polarization of mathematics education that is currently gripping national politics while it is true that any educational materials are political to some degree let us not fall into the pitfall that claims that good math teaching and learning is somehow at the far extreme of a leftist agenda further it would be ignorant to think that any framework that supports the education of all students is somehow limiting the success of some students talk to any public crowd at a grocery store and ask them how they liked their math education and youre likely to hear someone say im not a math person we have to change this narrative this framework makes strides to help students and teachers realize that everyone is a math person and anyone can learn math the inclusion of data science is exciting and forward looking the emphasis on multiple strategies representations and open ended tasks is based on research for what works best for students as a district teacher of the year and 25 year veteran with 5 years experience in specialized math instructional coaching i urge you to please adopt this framework  
-1	i strongly oppose the new california math framework and its stated goal of delaying algebra and all accelerated math in public schools until 9th grade children should have the opportunity to pursue an education that challenges them and allowed to accelerate in math if it is appropriate the framework will have a significant adverse effect on gifted and advanced learners including my own child who placed into algebra 1 in sixth grade and is thriving were this acceleration not offered in lausd i would have no choice but to unenroll him from the district entirely

-1	dear trustees the carlsbad education alliance cea is a coalition of parents students and staff in the carlsbad unified school district committed to transparency accountability and academic excellence cea opposes the new mathematics framework developed by the california department of education cde instructional quality commission iqc and state board of education sbe the cde website states that this framework will provide guidance designed to help educators align classroom teaching with californias rigorous math learning standards yet the rigorous standards referred to by the cde have failed to produce passing scores on national standardized math tests taken by california students and california continues to rank in the bottom quartile additionally on californias own smarter balanced state assessment only 33 of students met or exceeded math proficiency standards last year this is a failure on every level for californias students the newly proposed mathematics framework should focus solely on teaching math time and instruction on side issues like identity equity and social justice do not have a place in californias failing math curriculum those topics will not improve scores on statewide and nationwide standardized tests as educators it is your job to advise and implement instruction based on proven techniques and facts not theories and ideologies that are untested and unproven in reputable journals or publications we urge you to do better for californias students reject any and all components of the framework that do not solely contribute to creating a curriculum that will enable the majority of our students to pass standardized state and national tests its quite simple just teach math  
-1	this curriculum does not support all kids and does not take into account kids that need a more advanced curriculum   
-1	delaying advanced math availability will negatively impact the educational paths of our underprivileged and underrepresented students the most educated and middle class parents will provide out of school learning while our poorest have no opportunity to learn algebra before grade nine  
-1	do students feelings matter yes should our desire make students feel better come at the expense of mastering math absolutely not understanding math and the ability to use it to solve problems is both critical to our students success in later life and is quite objective you understand algebra or you dont you understand geometry or you dont you understand calculus or you dont the great state of california must not dilute our math curriculum or its grading standards in pursuit of student happiness  to do so would result in a disservice to a generation please take a close look at what unbiased math experts are saying and reject the cmf   
-1	we need to look at the states with the highest math proficiency in the nation and adopt their curriculum this is not mathematics that you want to adopt  
-1	there should be no change in math pathways the options provided now ensure that this country has mathematicians   
-1	mathematics particularly higherlevel math plays a vital role in shaping individuals and society it fosters critical thinking problemsolving abilities and logical reasoning all of which are essential skills for success in various aspects of life understanding math empowers individuals to analyze complex situations make informed decisions and effectively navigate the challenges of the modern world additionally math forms the foundation for many fields such as engineering finance technology and scientific research driving innovation and progress in society restricting access to rigorous math education not only limits individual opportunities but also hampers our collective ability to tackle future challenges and advance as a society  
-1	students who are gifted should have the opportunity to be in advanced classes to further sharpen their skills instead of being put in a class that will bore them as a product of a california public school i strongly believe math tracking will motivate students to work harder and learn more  
-1	the july 2023 draft of the mathematics framework has some serious flaws please see attachment  
-1	educators in the state of california should meet every student where they are today and help them go farther in math the pursuit of this goal has nothing to do with social or political views nor why students are where they are california must ratify a math framework that offers all students the ability to learn and be challenged if they so desire up to and including calculus in high school professor boalers political and social views have grossly overshadowed the pursuit of this goal and i hope the officials in charge of this process see that and hit the reset button we dont need activism in our schools we need backtobasics proven math education

-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting in the cmf the adopted california common core content standards are being replaced with big ideas aligned to 4 content connections which were not vetted shared with the ca public nor written by people with advanced math degrees the there is no evidence the big ideas will prepare our students for success in mathematics the sbe needs to require that a california math framework focus on the math content standards adopted by the state of california the proposed cmf will fail students especially struggling students as it shifts away from standardsbased instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards illdefined and vague big ideas which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered a california mathematics framework has the following goal this framework serves as a guide to implementing the california common core state standards for mathematics ca ccssm or the standards adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013 ch 1 line 37 yet only 63 of the cmf discusses or even lists specific ca math content standards 1072 lines out of 17088 lines the cmf has clearly failed to do its job in direct contrast to the job of a ca math framework the proposed cmf i ask you to reject recommends teaching big ideas as the content see evidence below who decided the big ideas should replace the content standards which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold phds in mathematics and which were vetted and voted on in california with public knowledge and input according to the cmf three individuals determined the big ideas for california and the cmf in chapter 3 line 244 and again in chapter 3 line 1468 we read three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 and three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following who are boaler munson and williams who apparently have the authority to determine what students in california will learn in math well of these three only 1 holds a degree in mathematics cathy williams has a bachelors in applied mathematics none of the three hold a master in mathematics and none of the three hold a phd in mathematics sbe you must reject a framework where big ideas created by nonmathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands if not california will fail to produce a stem workforce the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for stem careers additionally the cmf tells us these big ideas chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree are in fact just one interpretation of big ideas it should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics and those presented in these figures are one variation providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas ch 7 line 952 if this is the case and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards why doesnt the sbe put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in california why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students fate or allowing grade level teams who typically involve teachers without math degrees to decide what big ideas their students will learn this will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation furthermore in reading the cmf it is noted that the big ideas originated during distance learning so a focused set of big ideas indicated as big ideas was created as part of the california digital learning integration and standards guidance initiative cde 2021 these grade level big ideas organized by content connections and inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards are presented in the gradebanded chapters 6 7 and 8 ch 13 line 545 note the use of the phrase inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards why not all content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers evidence that the cmf wants to replace math content standards with their big ideas _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 6 line 228 _ the foundational mathematics contentñthat is the big ideas ch 6 line 942 _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 7 line 165 _ teachers should be teaching from big ideas not individual standards ch 10 line 177 _ educators of preservice teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authenticcontext bigideabased instruction described in this framework ch 10 line 247 so the big ideas proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past this replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design publishers teacher preparation programs and grading as well _ this framework reflects a revised approach advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas ch 1 line 405 _ to help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep active learning of mathematics for all students this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics

1	please see the attached letter of support for the 2023 mathematics framework from ellen barger cisc chair cisc mathematics subcommittee cochair associate superintendent curriculum  instruction santa barbara county office of education  
-1	the states guidelines for teaching mathematics should get back to basics an understanding of mathematics is critical to success in many fields including science engineering and business and in these fields that understanding should not be different from country to country attempting to achieve someones social goals although possibly important in other areas has no place in teaching mathematics california continues to fall further behind other states and the united states is falling behind countries like china because its educators are diluting the basics  
-1	 the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math  
-1	reject cmf 30 acceleration during high school when college acceptance is meticulously dependent on grades how is that good for mental health how does that protect against math anxiety we need students to be allowed to accelerate in middle school when grades dont matter and they can find themselves and experiment the approach to acceleration in this cmf is devastating to anyone not in private schools paying 5060kyear or who does not provide external tutoring and classes for students to compensate for this terrible public math education the idea that restricting acceleration in math to high school to reach advanced placement calculus in this cmf is horrible for mental health during high school students who did not get external tutoring in middle school will be compared to kids who did in our district in palo alto many parents including school board members send their kids to private school during middle school when that delaning experiment was implemented just before the pandemic then they come back with all their enrichment and are compared to the parents who trusted public education to prepare their kids students also receive a lot of pressure to downlane its destructive competition to get into college engineering programs is fierce and anyone who doesnt have ap calculus in high school has no chance particularly if they dont have straight as and 5s on their ap calculus exam the data science class is a pathway to a dead end and a signal to colleges that this student is not serious about stem and yet this cmf emphasizes it its like a prize for participation designed to make students feel good but everyone knows it is useless get a stem professional and a math professor like brian conrad on this writing team and listen to what he says or go back to the 2013 framework students are not widgets they are individuals and need to be placed in classrooms that are right for what they need not in some heterogeneous class that serves no one families need to be respected and told the truth about what successful preparation for stem is stop sending us the useless cmf once and for all and throw this cmf version out   
-1	you have taken an academic discipline and turned it into a political indoctrination tool identity has nothing to do with math problems nor does equity the only real objective to math is getting the correct answer if a student needs preceptory help getting up to speed lets find a way to give it to them but introducing a social justice element into math is pure hard leftwing politics and is cruel and inappropriate we see what youre doing  
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians  
-1	this cmf is a hodgepodge of disingenuous claims and statements and strategies sold using a selected subset of research which often is misrepresented as well for public policy one should do a fair honest evaluation this is far from it given the disaster that this kind of policy making created in reading for decades via essentially misrepresenting research one needs to stop this process really mississippi does better than california specifucally because they stopped believing in the education experts whose research was already dodgy listening to the experts is good but one should listen carefully and critically if the experts do not present evidence clearly and fairly one needs to believe them in fact one should exclude those who are making disingenuous arguments from any policy decisions or impact millions of children were harmed by deferring to these deceivers for decades in reading start over with actual people who are successful in their endeavors content experts for example

1	we are in a unique situation that isolates us from our neighbors  our community the school district boundary divides a block of 4 homes into 2 the boundary is not a cross streetend of a street but a fence dividing neighbors from each otherfences are meant as property lines not isolating children from those a few doors down our children are growing up in the ogsd community as their neighborhoodcommunity this is where we live and interact covid years were very tough on everyone but particularly difficult on young children our children went through significant anxiety issues being forced to go to the assigned schools of sjusd would only make psychological issues worsethe assigned schools are located within 3 separate communities none of which are walkable and would remove the children from their neighborhood peers  friends the interdistrict transfer process is there but it is inconsistent unreliable and leads to uncertainty as 1the transfer process is a criteria based annual application with no guarantee of admission year to year our eligibility criteria is employment based and is only valid for children k5 with no established criteria for gr 612  employment is never guaranteed how do we plan for 612 2 the application status is unknown until june  july making it impossible to plan for after school careactivity as this enrollment happens prior to june 3 transfer students are at a disadvantagethey fail to meet resident criteria for any special district programs because they will only be considered after resident students our application meets all the 9 technical criteria for a territory transfer and was supported by the scc office of educationit  would be unfair and disheartening to base a decision without considering all the variables that have changed since the boundary was created having familiarity with their surroundings  community provides children a safe spacestudent  parent involvement occurs naturally and spontaneously when you reside within the same community as your schoolsit  would be devastating if this was taken awaywe would never be able to feel the same connection with any of the allocated schools as they are not a part of the neighborhood in which we reside  are located within 3 separate communitieswe ask for certainty consistency and reliability we should not be discriminated against because of which side of the fence our property lies we are asking that children and their best interest be prioritized and the politics of outdated boundaries not interfere with what is right for children growing up within the ogsd  esuhsd neighborhoodif approved all 3 of the schools we would attend without any uncertainty would be within walking distance on safe neighborhood streets we hope you take this unique  bizarre boundary situation passing through the middle of our homes into account when making your decision please allow these children to continue thriving in the community where they reside  
-1	i am writing in opposition to item 11 algebra should be taught in 8th grade in public schools we should be advancing our children in mathematics   
-1	as a teacher mother of two intellectually gifted one highly gifted children and a gate coordinator i am aware that not all students who take accelerated math classes benefit from the experience however my own two children have thrived accelerating in math i made my 15 year old wait to accelerate until 7th grade and he has thrived and is more motivated in his math classes since accelerating as he is challenged and moving at a pace that matches his academic needs my 12 year old accelerated in 6th grade and is scoring over 100 in math i only let him accelerate by taking a course that covers 6th and 7th grade standards in one year and he has thrived being in an accelerated highly gifted magnet has motivated and challenged him in ways the general grade level classes were not i do see that skipping years of math can be problematic for the general population of students but for those who clearly have mastered grade level standards should not be slowed down or held back because of new standards rules students do not learn at the same pace and should be allowed to take math classes that meet their individual needs   
-1	i am a mathematician ba with distinction from university of pennsylvania part of my doctoral research involved analyzing active learning methods for teaching introductory calculus to undergraduates i tutored mentored and taught philadelphia magnet traditional and charter public school students of all ages throughout my 10 years in that city i am also a father of one deeply committed to public education the stated goals of the new math framework are laudable but the methods will frankly not achieve those goals and in the process will irreparably harm the schooling of millions of californian public school children tens or hundreds of thousands more will be driven away from the public school system leaving those who remain in public schools even further behind dr boalers work is the bedrock of this framework she is cited 28 times more than any other but the ca doe itself and 4x more than any other single human author to rely so heavily on the work of a nobel laureate would be questionable to do so for an author whose work is so highly controversial is plain irresponsible go back to the drawing board and start by involving a wider spectrum of voices into the curriculum design process or risk undermining the future of public education in california  
-1	our family has greatly benefited from having a program that has allowed our son now entering 10th grade to accelerate into a more advanced math course our daughter now entering 7th grade is set to start algebra next year we were happy to have our childhood stay in one size fits all model in elementary school but once children mature and find areas of of academic excellence why would we hold them back i have both my children in public school and i know these effects of one size fits all drive families out of public schools why limit our brightest and ambitious students why not offer more support for students with gaps in learning and help more kids excel   
1	i am a professor of mathematics and am excited at the potential for this framework to enable more of my students to enter university with an understanding of mathematics as a set of tools for examining situations they wonder about i believe that the diverse group of educators on the cfcc did an excellent job of shaping a vision of math education in which all students have opportunities to encounter deep connected mathematics as a member of the team of writers hired to help the cfcc put ideas into language i got a good appreciation for the thought and care that went into the emphases they chose for the framework the proposed framework represents an excellent step forward as we learn from 13 years of experience with the california common core standards in mathematics focusing instruction around the standards big ideas and helping students experience math from a place of curiosity and connection will go a long way towards substantially increasing the group of students who enter college as competent confident math and more broadly stem enthusiasts  
1	as an educator who has been focused on k8 math education and leadership since 2010 and over a decade of classroom teaching experience prior i strongly support this new framework and urge you to approve it thank you  
-1	this will do nothing for improving math scores take your cue from states that actually have high scores   
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors  
-1	delaying students who are ready and eager to learn at an accelerated pace is not the solution to addressing inequities rather it is the substitution of one inequity for another take the time and use the resources necessary to create a thoughtful option that meets the individual students learning needs   
-1	it was brought to my attention that the state framework for math has not had thorough research completed only 1 research paper was examined nor has the framework had many relevant changes made the math scores for the students in the state of ca have not increased with any consistency since its last update the framework has created testing requirements that are more of a challenge in the recent years as we are seeing more efforts to bring younger students into the educational setting along with an increase of students needing specialized academic learning services i believe more research into best practices for the teaching of younger students and students with disabilities needs to be addressed if the continuation of pushing down of age appropriate standards to younger students continue i fear we will have more students struggling with math thank you merriellen cohrs ed d  
1	the 2023 ca math framework has to be adapted because californias mathematics achievement ranks are below the national average and it is experiencing declines by the naep data statewide sb assessment confirmed that substantial achievement gaps exist which becomes a concern because schools are oriented for mathematical understanding for college and career preparedness this situation is addressed by the 2023 ca math framework as recommended by the california department of education cde it supports students and teachers and promotes effective teaching and learning it ensures the progression of mathematical understanding of students and supports culturally diverse learners el and students with disability with instructional practices all these are the reasons to support the 2023 ca math framework   
-1	the california common core state standards include calculus and statistics for k12 each and every student might not choose to pursue a stem degree but each and every student should have the opportunity to complete all the math up to in including high school calculus as well as probability and statistics standards the framework falls short of describing easily accessible pathways to calculus and statistics figure 84 exemplifies my point my comment including the figure is attached where is the clear and accessible path to completing foundational math and calculus and statistics my district san francisco unified sfusd struggled with implementing common core math and providing easily accessible pathways to the foundational math through calculus sfusd created two options an inaccessible for all pathway and an antithetical compression course pathway make no mistake those with resources found workarounds to sfusds pathways and will find workarounds to this framework im writing on behalf of those with limited access to resources the framework needs to identify a clear and accessible path for all students desiring to complete all the common core math standards including calculus and statistics as currently written the framework fails to do so  
-1	calc 
-1	holding kids back in their learning is detrimental to their emotional psychological and academic well being these students are the future of our country they will be the future leaders inventors and educators believe it or not the kids who take these courses have a need that should be filled you dont take remedial courses or sports programs away please dont take these accelerated courses away   
1	i want to express my support for the adoption of the current version of the 2023 ca mathematics framework based on the following reasons 1 the introduction of drivers of investigation create an opportunity to connect school mathematics to the math used explored and enjoyed outside of the school setting by many 2 highlighting the role of language needed to engage in the standards for mathematical practices provides an opening to move beyond learning math as an answer getting endeavor towards mathematics as a subject that requires students to access complex text and to communicate their reasoning 3 the framework is a start of a conversation between secondary schools community colleges cal states and ucs about course offering needed at all levels to help students meet their career aspirations please approve this math framework ca students cans afford to keep waiting  
-1	i am opposed to this politically correct framework for teaching math it ignores systems that have been successful and focuses on social themes im very disappointed that our leadership in the superintendents office has chosen this erroneous path as a retired educator i saw what worked with students and what did not they have to have more of a focus on rote memorization as well as understanding the concepts i am opposed to this new mathematics framework in my opinion it should be scrapped and start again check out school systems that have been successful in teaching math and follow their lead and then leave the politics out of teaching math please  
-1	ive watched our girls in school and am severely disappointed in how math is being taught this makes it even worse we need to go back to math being math teach the basics have consistency and repetition math should just be math  
-1	i oppose for the same reasons that professor jelani nelson of uc berkeley has stated far better than i can ever explain i will only add math standards ought to be raised and kept high for students to ensure our students are the best prepared in the world its the only way we will continue to compete against our adversaries like russia and china and remain the leading economic military and intellectual superpower that we currently are if students from california public schools enter a cal state or uc unprepared for the rigors of the coursework because of lowered math standards their educational system has failed them not helped them additionally some students may not be particularly good at math but may still be intellectually gifted and extremely talented in other fields of study lowering math standards does not help those students it only has potential to distract them thats because a student like that should see high math standards recognize advanced math may not be their forte and have the opportunity to pursue other equally rigorous and academically challenging paths instead where their talents will lie thank you for consideration of my comments  
-1	enough is enough get back to the basics a solid foundation in k3 means that children know their facts in all areas addition subtraction multiplication and division first with this in place the implementation of higher concepts is attainable and with fewer errors in basic math issues in the upper grades this can be achieved while incorporating critical thinking skills and building a life long interest in mathematics hands on algebrain the early years 35 is a game changer in order to promote a zest for math and take the fear out of the subject for many students pay attention to what successful students know and why they are stars in class they have a solid foundation by the end of 3rd grade and easily advance to higher math by 6th grade a skilled teacher can make a difference by being creative and innovative with her basic skills development for every type of mathematics learner train them and be specific about goals accountability is the key   
-1	i oppose the adoption of the new cmf math framework 1 the proposal continues to have proselytism and political activism pushing social justice agendas there is no need to call for race and sexual preference in math for homework line 778 2 overall the proposal will widen the gap between families with resources who can afford extra classes to complement math education versus families wo resources we can even refer to the governor of california his four kids are attending private school which provides extra resources and advanced classes vs public schools 3 k12 is to give building blocks and a strong foundation california kids will be in disadvantage comparing to kids from other countries a mediocre child from china probably knows more math than a medium student from california 4 line 318320 charts  why the scales are different and why there are less students on figure 92 if you put the federal in this case the state government in charge of the sahara desert in five years thered be a shortage of sand it seems that the same applies to education year by year the standards are lower and lower  
-1	this is marxist math teach our kids the same curriculums as states with the highest grades and test scores levels in math and science  stop this ideology teaching its offensive thank you   
-1	i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem  
-1	i write in opposition of the third field review of the california mathematics framework cmf while the third draft of the cmf shows some improvement over the second field review primarily the removal of the mathematics investigating and connecting mic pathway as a third proposed pathway in chapter 8 the overall document retains too many of the problems present in the first and second drafts to be salvageable as to the issues that persist with the third field review of the cmf that make it unsalvageable  while acknowledging the failings of californias public schools on the whole in providing minimal mathematics instruction to its students the cmf merely asserts that the solution is to adopt the cmf writers preferred instructional approaches there is a large body of research and experience that indicates alternative approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve mathematics instruction  the lead writer of the cmf writing team  jo boaler  had a conflict of interest because much of the research cited to support the authors claims particularly with regard to detracking as well as approaches recommended come from her own forprofit organization  youcubedorg  boaler earns substantial income consulting with ca public school districts advising on mathematics curricular changes  the cmf is an overly political document that focuses on equity from the first chapter chapter 1 states reflecting the states commitment to equity every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all two entire chapters  2 and 9  are devoted exclusively to equity as the authors define it that understanding of equity can be gleaned from the glossary in chapter 14 of the cmf equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness drawing from gutierrez 2012 equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education 1 access to tangible resources 2 participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them 3 student identity development in mathematics and 4 attention to relations of power the third and fourth dimensions of equity are by the authors own admission in her 2012 paper rooted in critical theory a curriculum framework should not contain a political orientation or political recommendations  the instructional recommendations recommended in the cmf are poorly supported ignore research that supports competing recommendations and are often justified by dubious research or questionable summarizations of the research cited this is tacitly acknowledged by the wested researchers hired to write the third field review as they removed references to san francisco unified school districts failed policy of delaying algebra 1 to 9th grade yet claims continue to be made based on those references  if the instructional and policy recommendations in the cmf are followed by california school districts it is my informed opinion that california k12 students achievements in mathematics will continue to decline the first chapter of the cmf says it is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics connected to each other and to authentic real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs this focus on big ideas connection to authentic student contexts and vague notions of multidimensional ways rooted in udl will necessarily reduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills  
1	for 21 years i have been a k8 educator most of my students have been students of color low socioeconomic backgrounds english learners with learning differences or a combination of all these i have taught using both traditional pedagogy and culturally responsive equitable pedagogy ive seen firsthand how much difference in student outcomes it makes to use culturally responsive and equitable practices with our most vulnerable students math success is not only important in the lives of the individuals we serve but also for our community at large the future of the california economy and quality of life for everyone in our state depends on the quality of mathematics instruction of all students in public education today not just some students this 2023 revised framework gives schools the guidance necessary to produce positive outcomes for every student based on wellestablished research and field experience if the pedagogy described in the framework enhances the mathematical success of all students how can we not use it i support the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework wholeheartedly because i believe in our students and i believe in our educators to meet the important challenge of educating every student no matter who they are

-1	i completely agree with mike lawlers comments on the cmf he said the prior drafts of the cmf had serious problems with accurate and appropriate references claims that have been removed from prior drafts include i the repeat rate in san francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to 9th grade fell from 40 to 8 and ii most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math problems with references continue with this draft my recommendation is that all references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either removed or replaced with proper references if they cannot be replaced the items in the cmf that depend on the nonacademic references need to be removed too ill provide two examples of nonacademic references below that should be removed but these are just two examples to make the point clear all of the nonacademic references need to be examined carefully by the california department of education for example the boaler munson and williams reference from youcubed  what is mathematical beauty is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for books written by the authors as boaler is also an author of the cmf having a reference advertising her books included in the cmf is inappropriate a second example is the boaler and foster paper on youcubed  raisin expectations and achievement again this is not academic research the paper has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the cmf as political it is inappropriate to have a reference in the cmf criticizing opposition to the cmf this paper also discusses a study  referred to as study 2 in the paper  that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015 this comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student achievement from a score difference on an algebra ii test one year and an 8th grade math test in the next year this reference to the study in this paper in chapter 9 of the cmf goes even farther to state without reference or explanation that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling the claims about study 2 in chapter 9 of the cmf are an example of important claims in the cmf in this case tracking that are not backed by published academic research again this reference  and all nonacademic research cited in the cmf  needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic research as this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015 there has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores if the only discussion of these exam scores is the post on youcubed this reference and the discussion about tracking supported by it needs to be removed there are millions of students in california whose lives will be affected by the cmf it is the responsibility of the california department of education to ensure that the ideas in the document are supported properly non academic work like blog posts books or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as academic work the inclusion of advertisements and political statements about opposition are obviously not appropriate references nonacademic studies cannot be central to the cmfs proposal either once the references are corrected or the material removed what remains in the cmf can be evaluated properly  
-1	the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability students are grouped together see chapter nine or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableñas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived ability so that students soon understand who is the high kid and who is the low kid in the group aside from
-1	i am a public school parent whose children have tried out math models in alignment with the new cmf please see my attached letter for the reasons i oppose adopting the revised draft   
-1	dear state board of education members i have concerns with the current mathematics framework and would recommend additional emphasis on offering accelerated mathematics tracks for any california middle or highschool students with sufficient aptitude and desire to enroll i am writing as a private citizen and professional engineer accelerated math tracks specifically algebra in middle school and precalculus  calculus in high school were essential preparation for me when i enrolled in my core undergraduate math courses even with a strong foundation it was challenging to keep up with peers as we quickly moved through matrix algebra integral  differential calculus and statistics in our first year this mathematical training was foundational for our future careers i am currently at a materials company developing next generation components for lithium ion batteries i can directly trace how my mathematics training supported my decision to enter a stem field and to participate in an innovative business located here in california its not fair or equitable to take away accelerated math tracks from public school students by watering down or eliminating accelerated math tracks in california public schools the current framework makes it difficult for our students to thrive in stem careers in fact im concerned it will exacerbate inequality making it harder for our public school students to access advanced math training please consider placing additional emphasis on accelerated or honors classes in the adopted math framework instructors such as professor conrad at stanford university have provided more specific recommendations on ways to improve the current framework id encourage the board to adopt them   kind regards william  
1	the new math framework is a step towards creating more access and opportunity for students to develop mathematical thinking and problem solving current neuroscience research shows that all students have the ability to learn and grow given strong instruction and learning opportunities the way this framework is set up gives teachers the ability to provide students of diverse skill and backgrounds entry points for learning and no limits to their learning trajectory as an educator i want students to be able to come into the classroom and meet their needs it moves away from the outdated ideas that only certain students are math gifted or have math brains this is an important way for califorina to invest in all of our students  by seeing the potential in each of them empowering students with the mathematical thinking and analytical skills will create stronger individuals who are ready for college careers and community engagement even if students do not pursue a stem career they would be able to use concepts to do data analysis problem solving and critical thinking in professional and personal environments there is skepticism about detracking students and whether this will diminish students ability to excel in a diverse classroom however math can be multidimensional and creative in its approach without diminishing rigor teachers have long differentiated instruction to meet student needs if students are in a diverse classroom they all benefit from the divergent thinking and approaches to math they will be able to learn from one another and the multiple perspectives that are in the classroom there are no limits in learning using this framework classrooms could also become more collaborative inquiry based and engaging students who are more engaged in classes are more likely to stay on task and reach learning objectives this framework is a foundation for schools to launch academic programs and instruction that will meet the current needs of our student population it is an investment in our future that will support our state and nation because it empowers a new generation of learners thinkers and creators  
-1	dear sirs if you design math education for kids who hate math youre punishing kids who like math its selfdefeating and thats what youre doing here if you want to solve the problem that elite college admission departments require too much calculus you ought to take it up with elite college admission departments they are after all the ones wholly in charge of elite college admissions just limiting how much math you are willing to teach the california students who love math ð and they exist i was one i am raising two ð is an absurdly roundabout and likely totally ineffective way to achieve your stated goals instead i humbly suggest that you build more schools for the academically gifted not fewer and build them in minority neighborhoods not in the san fernando valley and maybe change how the hgm admission testing works theres nothing magic about the way youre doing it now sincerely lewis morton parent of 2 kids in lausd  
-1	i am writing as a parent and stakeholder with two children in californias public school system my children attend high school and middle school in the los angeles unified school district lausd in the city of los angeles ca they have attended ca public schools since they were in kindergarten stakeholders are addressed in ch 1 of the california math framework our family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both traditional math programs and models that align with the new california math framework in their respective schools having lived experience with the recommendations put forth in the cmf i am writing to urge the ca boe to reject the proposed california math framework in its current form i have heard the phrase your children are not a data set but they are the data set i know the best my kids took math at public schools that have adopted the recommendations contained in the new cmf and math at public schools that did not both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed cmf models of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs that did not employ the cmfs recommendations my childrens first elementary school was an independent charter named larchmont charter school in los angeles larchmont was an early adopter of the cmfs proposed models years before other public schools worked to align themselves with the new cmf faculty at larchmont charter school worked closely with uclas center x ucla mathematics project to incorporate cgi math into their curriculum larchmont teachers followed jo boaler at stanford and her work building on carol dwecks growth mindsets which guided them in creating model math classrooms for their students larchmont was a highperforming school with engaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the pd the resulting math program however was not effective for my two kids both of whom work several years above grade level my students bemoaned the coursework which was remedial repetitive slowpaced and featured a lot of writing about their thinking for very simple concepts once they moved over to lausd proper which followed a more traditional math path they both soared ahead and discovered they loved math in fifth grade my daughter remarked i cant believe larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm using a standard algorithm and justédoing math problems made everything click into place for these particular kids i was therefore dismayed to see the current cmf recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until much later in elementary ð using culminating standards as a guide of when to teach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the common core see elementary school guidance re when multiplication division etc are taught cmf page 83 but larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models last year in lausd our childs former school gaspar de portola middle school implemented a pilot program for the district that was aligned with the new cmf portola switched from teaching the big ideas math curriculum to illustrative math in 20222023 teachers underwent extensive pd parent booster groups spent tens of thousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new curriculum again the progressive math model executed by excellent teachers and staff was a disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace gaspar de portola middle school houses a highly gifted magnet hgm for kids who typically work 3 years ahead of grade level parents at the hgm knowing nothing about the math wars raging in sacramento were incredibly dismayed by the new curriculum one parent a stem phd and retired astrophysicist patiently did every problem set in both the big ideas traditional textbook and the new illustrative math textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the new progressive model dismayed by what he found he wrote a letter to our principal which i am excerpting here as for im first of all i strongly applaud lausd and portolas initiative and effort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state of math proficiency in the general student population in lausd and in the country im textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited to many if not most students needs and ability im tries to make students fully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by reorganizing math topics offering a lot of repetitions and showing various ways to explain the same concepts my son name withheld i believe is benefitting from ims methodology repetitiveness and slower pace however i have to say that im does not serve hgm kids needs well at all especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond and is a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability ultimately it does not prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like precal and calculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and approach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like big idea math here are some of the ims shortcomings as a highschool level math textbook in the context of hgm especially algebra 12 and geometry im covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower knowledge base due to its slower pace it does not delve deep enough into materials compared to big ideas math and other common core math textbooks it offers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts which bores and even confuses students im lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and seems to be a watereddown version of traditional math textbooks ims approach does not align with that of college textbooks im doesnt offer enough texts guidelines and exercises after each lessonchapter for students to further their investigation and study after school ims lessonchapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard mathematical terms equations theorems and conventions
1	please see attached comments patrick callahan and i support the adoption of the framework but believe that some editing needs to be done to make sure that the treatment of functions and modeling is comparable in the traditional and integrated pathways dear sbe members the current version of the 2023 mathematics framework for california schools represents a significant improvement over the previous draft and we support its adoption we do however wish to note one point that needs attention chapter 8 of the framework sets forth two primary pathways through the secondary mathematics curriculum the traditional and the integrated pathways given that both pathways are intended to address the same content and practices those delineated in the common core we expected to see closely parallel descriptions of the mathematical content to be covered in the two approaches this was not the case regarding perhaps the most fundamental concept in mathematics the concept of function including the use of functions in mathematical modeling discrepancies can be seen easily by looking at figures 85 and 88 describing the traditional pathway as compared to figures 813 and 816 describing the integrated pathway in both pathways we find modeling with functions and some structural investigations eg systems of equations ð but in figures 813 and 816 we also find comparing models function representations functions in the world and equations to predict and model as we see it the frameworks description of the integrated pathway provides a much richer ð and more appropriate given our understanding of the common core ð description of the ways in which students should encounter functions and modeling the description of functions and modeling in the traditional pathway should be comparably rich in what follows we suggest a few ways in which this difference can be addressed  early in the chapter it might be good to stress the central role of functions and modeling across the entire secondary curriculum this might be done by adding text like the following after line 130 one fundamental use of mathematics is to model realworld situations for example the costs of different cellphone plans the changing values of used cars or the different sizes and comparative costs of different pizzas what all these situations have in common is that the objects and relationships between them can be expressed in mathematical terms often with one such object being expressible as a function of another once a situation has been described in that way it can be analyzed mathematically to discover relationships find patterns and make predictions as students progress through the secondary curriculum they encounter increasingly complex mathematical functions and relationships and increasingly sophisticated ways to represent and analyze data they begin by working with linear functions sets of linear functions and some polynomial families of functions for example quadratics later on they encounter logarithmic exponential and trigonometric functions the mathematical objects or analytic methods they encounter may be new ð but the processes of mathematizing and sensemaking are the same its like writing essays using a larger vocabulary and with an improved capacity for making complex arguments the goal whether for applications or the study of mathematical objects and relations in their own right is to develop robust understandings and habits of sensemaking with an increasingly large toolkit of concepts and functions  there is also room for expansion in the brief description of algebra i in lines 944952 at minimum the opening sentence beginning on line 944 can be expanded to say the main purpose of algebra i is to develop students understanding of and fluency with linear quadratic and exponential functions and their use to model realworld phenomena the words in italics are additions  might it be possible to expand figures 85 and 88 to include some of the key ideas in figures 813 and 816  in addition we note that the big ideas for geometry fail to include deductive reasoning that is formalizing and proof are presented as good in themselves in fact the fundamental goal is reasoning ð in the early nctm standards they were conjoined as reasoning and proof it would be good to have a statement somewhere along the following lines producing a proof should not be seen as a way to meet abstract requirements regarding the ways that mathematical claims should be presented but rather as the end product of reasoning and sensemaking organized and presented in ways that make it easier to convey the resulting understandings respectfully submitted alan schoenfeld university of california berkeley patrick callahan callahan consulting

-1	im concerned about the lack of research used to construct the new k12 mathematical framework it appears that the framework was heavily built upon jo boalers work while other valuable and work was left out i do not condone adopting any policies or procedures that are not built upon a variety of research  
-1	the cmfs vision of teaching math will harm our black and brown students why is a white women with no math background and whom has attacked a black professor at ucb with the threat of calling the police in charge of an initiative that would take away opportunities for talented black brown and poor students to advance this initiative will also ensure white flight from public schools   
1	i am a retired mathematics professor from csu sacramento and was a member of the academic content standards commission when it recommended the ccss ive worked with the board and with cde on numerous documents over recent decades and have extensive experience with situations where policy decisions are fraught with politics going back to the california math wars and the 1997 math standards the board has listened to the objections to the previous drafts and has made appropriate clarifications and explications resulting in a better document one that makes progress in notable ways especially in providing greater foundations for success for the full diversity of californias population the time has come to approve it and to turn energies to its implementation which in my opinion is where the greatest difference can be made to vote this down could open the door for insurgent reactionary politics and endless policy fighting please adopt this mathematics framework  
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors see also this recent article that speaks directly to this    
1	board of education i fully support and endorse the ambitious vision of this proposed framework i urge you to adopt and support its implementation as mathematics lesson study participants we have had the opportunity to apply much of the researchbased pedagogy stated in the draft mathematics framework which has resulted in continuously seeing students change from nonparticipants in mathematics classes to becoming mathematics thinkers and doers from this sample of ca classrooms and their existence proof i am very much encouraged that progress can be made to implement this framework system wide will take time continuous professional learning as well as ongoing communication with the community i appreciate the framework highlighting data science since it is integral to making sense of the jobs we do citizenship responsibilities medical decisions climate science etc it is essential for students to understand that data and statistics impact every aspect of our lives understanding critiquing and applying data science is essential if we are going to make reasoned decisions about improvements i would hope that educators can use data science as we transition to using the ideas embedded in this framework to analyze our progress and inquiries into implementation efforts understanding there will be strengths and weaknesses in our efforts i am hopeful for teachers and students in our state that we will have the opportunity to leverage this framework to craft meaningful mathematics learning for our students and ourselves the ca board of education and writing teams should be commended for articulating this complex vision of mathematics instruction and their investment in improving learning opportunities for each and every california student  
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians furthermore there is a gross conflict of interest with jo boaler leading this harmful framework and her youcubed project this entire initiative needs to be scrapped with real mathematicians leading the helm including mathematicians and professors of color who are lacking in the current committee   
-1	the cmfs vision of teaching math will harm our black and brown students  
-1	i strongly oppose to the proposed california math framework i have been teaching math in california for 41 years and have a degree in mathematics i have carefully studied the proposed framework it steers teachers away from using clear direct instruction and from requiring their students to master math facts and algorithms at the right stages of their mathematical development for example students who do not memorize their times tables by the end of 3rd grade typically struggle when they try to learn fractions in 4th grade or decimals in 5th grade etc the framework is opposed to the common core standards on this point  yet the framework is intended to help teachers implement the common core standards the proposed framework will be particularly harmful to students whose families do not have the resources to pay for private math tutors or afterschool classes to supplement their math education affluent families will be better positioned to seek outside help for their children to succeed in middle and high school math and prepare for stem careers this will widen the existing achievement gap even further there is no legitimate research to back up the claims of the framework which in many cases defy common sense instead the claims are supported by blog posts by one of the authors or by small scale studies with falsified data none of it peerreviewed it has been clearly established that the claimed success of san franciscos detracking experiment was actually based on false claims or math errors please reject this proposed mathematics framework californias children deserve much better   
1	the revised 2023 framework is an excellent step in the right direction and will help secure a strong foundation for students in mathematics the foundation is critical in giving all students an opportunity for success where as past frameworks have isolated students and divided them in a top down approach the revised framework gives a much clearer direction for districts to follow as well as curriculum developers that have continued to use past standards in their pedagogy in order to market their product the new framework will hold teachers more accountable and enforce a needed change in instructional practices in order to compete with other countries that continue to surpass our students in achievement common core was never really implemented and the new framework will stabilize the message that we are moving forward and not backward its time we all get on the same page and stop looking at the past as we already know where that will lead   
-1	our students are failing at epic rates leave this marxist math out of the curriculum political agendas should not be infused with teaching our students fundamental math skills   
1	all california children deserve access to a highquality mathematics education in which they experience mathematics concepts as interconnected and applicable to the many contexts necessary for 21st century jobs and careers the proposed ca math framework offers valuable guidance for enacting the ca ccssm through curriculum and instructional approaches grounded in research and reflecting best practices from classrooms the snapshots and vignettes provide opportunities for all students to engage in rich mathematical tasks using the standards for mathematical practice students are counting on your vote to affirm recommendations supported by the national council of teachers of mathematics just equations todos and many other organizations that support equitable math instruction  
-1	reject cmf 30 heterogeneously leveled classes are a disaster speaking from experience the cmf places all students from a particular grade in the same class thus superficially eliminating the appearance of disparities my child has lived through these delaned classes in middle school this one size fits all classroom with complex problems that have minimal reinforcement of each students individual instructional needs and it does not serve any of the students complex word problems are hard for nonnative speakers to understand and find math concepts struggling students dont get the extra practice and close attention they need because only a fraction of the problem is relevant to them students who have mastered the material are frustrated because they cannot progress to their full potential the excuse i was repeatedly given for making my child repeat material she has already mastered in these classrooms is that she would have deeper learning but i have spent many years looking in the scientific literature and have found no operational definition of the concept or demonstration that heterogeneous classes geared at lower level instruction help students instead parents of these advanced students who have means pay for external classes and tutors during middle school to overcome this problem in high school those without financial means that have not had this enrichment and cant compete and likely receive lower grades and grades determine whether they have a chance at these highly competitive engineering programs the palo alto district they tried to enforce this delaning in high school to accomplish this they violated the california math placement act by forcing most students into the same geometry class as high school freshmen they made it a graduation requirement regardless of whether they already took the class they refused to perform testing to evaluate whether this class would benefit the student this was the legal violation struggling students complained about having stronger students in their class because this caused them stress and was unfair competition encouraging economically disadvantaged students that receive lower grades to take data science instead of calculus sabotages their chances of a stem college degree the san francisco public school model of delaying algebra 1 until high school made reaching calculus impossible without paying for external classes thus destroying any chance at equity for economically disadvantaged students blocking access to calculus makes being accepted to college engineering virtually impossible even if these students were allowed into these programs covering advanced math in high school saves stemaspiring economically disadvantaged students college tuition for those same courses and still worse entering a stem college program without adequate preparation makes disadvantaged students vulnerable to being weeded out and left with high tuition debts   
-1	our children deserve the highest standards in math requirements and curriculum do not adopt this new math framework that focuses on incorporating social justice diversity equity and inclusion standards in a math curriculum keep the math standards objective and free from political correctness our children deserve to be proficient in math so they can be future leaders in science and engineering technology and other industries

-1	two sons in sfusd  one before and one after the disastrous abolition of 8th grade algebra and the introduction of the new curriculum that forms the basis of this proposed state frame the older son was so well prepared for college and just received an engineering degree the younger son was completely unprepared for college level math in spite of straight as in watered down math classes and this has closed a lot of doors for him tech degrees are a path out of poverty and this math framework means that path will be closed to poor californian kids

review tfr and retain the 2013 cmf the cmfs third field review begins by discussing ca students poor math proficiency and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation of its ideological and pedagogical proposals ignoring that its proposals may actually make student proficiency worse the same tfr proposals made student proficiency worse at sfusd where detracking and equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014 sfusds math program the tfrs mirror image has led to decreased student math proficiency and increased inequity see sfusd caaspp results 201617 to 201819 see sfusd at the research doesnt add up at savemathnet see ffsf inequity in numbers report see ôput algebra 1 back in 8th grade ridgeway margulies now that the failure of sfusds math program is known it isnt mentioned in the tfr though sfusd did figure prominently in the cmfs first field review ffr by avoiding mention of sfusd the tfr avoids drawing attention to the failure of its own proposals this tactic isnt surprising as the tfr continues to propose implementing these same failed proposals for all of cas almost 6 million public school children even the evidence the tfr does put forward to support its signature detracking proposal from which so many of its other proposals stem is compromised the key supporting study in the tfr known as ôthe railside study has been heavily critiqued and some would say discredited further its lead author a writer of the cmf hasnt responded to requests to share data to permit independent verification of its results another key detracking paper cited in the tfr ôraising expectations 2021 is an unpublished non peer reviewed scantily detailed paper which one commentator called ôa blog post see mikeandallie tweets the one study the tfr cites that shows detracking student benefit is misrepresented by shading discussion of the studys findings to emphasize just the detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention presumably because it is a study of 8th grade algebra acceleration for all which the tfr discourages ôthe railside study and the ôraising expectations papers claim that detracking leads to student academic benefit but neither can reliably support that conclusion sfusds results certainly do not support it detracking is the core tfr goto proposal from which other proposals stem such as heterogeneous differing student math level classrooms through 10th grade the use of ôbig ideas and ôrich ôopen math tasks to permit multiple entry level points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels and the use of ôcomplex instruction to manage interactions in the heterogeneous classroom none of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student academic outcomes in any case sfusd has already implemented all of these proposals as a package and the result was decreased student math proficiency see sfusd caaspp results 201617 to 201819 and increased inequity see ôput algebra 1 back in 8th grade ridgeway margulies tfr suggests implementing the same proposals statewide is it because the tfrs ideological commitment to detracking equity equitable outcomes takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes at times the tfr reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum framework for example the tfr says the cmfs goal is ôequity ch 1 the tfrs glossary defines ôequity as ôfairness not sameness but ôfairness and ôsameness arent similarly defined the ôequity definition points to a paper gutierrez 2012 context mattersé and a rubric within the paper to explain how achieving equity in math education will occur the 4 dimension rubric however is based on marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics see page 20 in context mattersé gutierrez 2012 the tfr text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from critical race theory like ôequity ôequitable outcomes ôsystemic change ôsystemic issues ôexamine inequitiesôstructural barriers ôstructural injustices ôinstitutional injustices ôchallenge the status quo ôsocial order ôculture of exclusion ôinequitable ôinequities ôchallenge inequities ôstructural inequities ôsystemic inequities ôhistorically marginalized and ôhistorically underrepresented all of which are part of the crt lexicon and stem from its core tenet of ôsystemic racism crts contested ideology derived from marxism can be described as it crt is a marxian faith system based on the belief that society is organized by white people for their own benefit through something critical race theorists call ôsystemic racism james lindsay ôwhat is critical race theory critical race theory workshop session 1 822 and onward ôawakening a true racial consciousness that is aware of this systemic racism and that unequivocally rejects it and whiteness itself as its root is therefore the chief program of critical race theory james lindsay ôrace marxism new discourses pg 13 while critical race theory aims to raise a ôracial consciousness the tfr promoted pedagogy culturally relevant teaching aims to raise a ôcritical consciousness according to the calif dept of education cde culturally relevant teaching consists of three components all of which ômust be utilized including supporting a students ôcritical consciousness which is the ability to recognize and critique societal inequalities the term ôcritical consciousness comes from the brazilian marxist paulo freire and is designed to create marxist political activists by engaging in marxist thought reform see ôthe marxification of education social and emotional learning sel also makes an appearance in the cmf tfr ch 13 strands of sel such as transformational sel and others also derive from marxism according to new discourses the tfr also includes elements from gender ideology and a section on ôteaching towards social justice suggesting both should be incorporated into math curriculum and instruction its not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum thats a problem its that the tfr favors ideological proposals known to lead to academic failure and its also that these ideologies if implemented in public school would contravene a number of state and federal laws and constitutional provisions the purpose of a state curriculum framework is to
-1	hello im flabbergasted at the lack of research with in the new k12 mathematical framework why does it appear as if only jo boalers research was included as a math teacher for 17 years in a low income school in california this concerns me ive read and used ideas from both of boalers books some work and some do not what about research from   i was unable to find anything in our new framework california leads the united states in number of students taught this responsibility needs to be taken seriously and with lots of research not just one persons research please consider putting off the adoption until additional research of good mathematical practices can be included thank you jeaninne cavazos   
-1	congratulation this plan is going to accomplish many things but improve the children of californias math skills is not going to be one of them i wish i could say i read everything completely but with the limited time you allowed to review and over a holiday weekend i was not able to accomplish that task as i will assumed your release planned to accomplish minimum responses from what i read im impressed you took a basic subject such as math and politicized it with solutions that will not only lower mathematical competency but put a larger burden on the system especially those with task of teaching this subject i would suggest you look at areas where students thrive in math and attempt to emulate them countries such as china and philippines have excelled in this subject as have the states of massachusetts utah and idaho as a california student i was fortunate to be able to perform math functions acceptability my skill set wasnt the result of me being included or coming from a higher economical background i was good because i was taught the basic and had to repetitively solve different problems that where presented to me like anything the more i did it the problems the better myself and the classmates who kept up did it was a simple concept that will still work today i dont know how california lost its way in basic teaching curriculum i guess the worry now must be pornographic books not being as your offices says banned from library that would be threatening to certain students i dont know what math skills are going to be gained from teaching equity maybe you will have to emphasize division in order to teach equality two subjects that separate and devoid from each other just like in a casino i will have to wish the students of california a hardy good luck with this framework the odds just like in a casino are going to be against them the students will need luck in order to learn math skills with this plan  
-1	its beyond disappointing as a parent of two public school students that the state of california would consider moving towards an unproven framework focused on equity as opposed to allowing students to progress at their own rate this similar approach at sfusd has been a disaster if the state wants to see more students leave the system this is a sure fire way of making that happen please do not move forward with the current proposed math framework

focused proposals have been implemented since 2014 sfusds math program the tfrs mirror image has led to decreased student math proficiency and increased inequity see sfusd caaspp results 201617 to 201819 see sfusd at the research doesnt add up at savemathnet see ffsf inequity in numbers report see ôput algebra 1 back in 8th grade ridgeway margulies now that the failure of sfusds math program is known it isnt mentioned in the tfr though sfusd did figure prominently in the cmfs first field review ffr by avoiding mention of sfusd the tfr avoids drawing attention to the failure of its own proposals this tactic isnt surprising as the tfr continues to propose implementing these same failed proposals for all of cas almost 6 million public school children even the evidence the tfr does put forward to support its signature detracking proposal from which so many of its other proposals stem is compromised the key supporting study in the tfr known as ôthe railside study has been heavily critiqued and some would say discredited further its lead author a writer of the cmf hasnt responded to requests to share data to permit independent verification of its results another key detracking paper cited in the tfr ôraising expectations 2021 is an unpublished non peer reviewed scantily detailed paper which one commentator called ôa blog post see mikeandallie tweets the one study the tfr cites that shows detracking student benefit is misrepresented by shading discussion of the studys findings to emphasize just the detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention presumably because it is a study of 8th grade algebra acceleration for all which the tfr discourages ôthe railside study and the ôraising expectations papers claim that detracking leads to student academic benefit but neither can reliably support that conclusion sfusds results certainly do not support it detracking is the core tfr goto proposal from which other proposals stem such as heterogeneous differing student math level classrooms through 10th grade the use of ôbig ideas and ôrich ôopen math tasks to permit multiple entry level points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels and the use of ôcomplex instruction to manage interactions in the heterogeneous classroom none of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student academic outcomes in any case sfusd has already implemented all of these proposals as a package and the result was decreased student math proficiency see sfusd caaspp results 201617 to 201819 and increased inequity see ôput algebra 1 back in 8th grade ridgeway margulies tfr suggests implementing the same proposals statewide is it because the tfrs ideological commitment to detracking equity equitable outcomes takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes at times the tfr reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum framework for example the tfr says the cmfs goal is ôequity ch 1 the tfrs glossary defines ôequity as ôfairness not sameness but ôfairness and ôsameness arent similarly defined the ôequity definition points to a paper gutierrez 2012 context mattersé and a rubric within the paper to explain how achieving equity in math education will occur the 4 dimension rubric however is based on marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics see page 20 in context mattersé gutierrez 2012 the tfr text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from critical race theory like ôequity ôequitable outcomes ôsystemic change ôsystemic issues ôexamine inequitiesôstructural barriers ôstructural injustices ôinstitutional injustices ôchallenge the status quo ôsocial order ôculture of exclusion ôinequitable ôinequities ôchallenge inequities ôstructural inequities ôsystemic inequities ôhistorically marginalized and ôhistorically underrepresented all of which are part of the crt lexicon and stem from its core tenet of ôsystemic racism crts contested ideology derived from marxism can be described as it crt is a marxian faith system based on the belief that society is organized by white people for their own benefit through something critical race theorists call ôsystemic racism james lindsay ôwhat is critical race theory critical race theory workshop session 1 822 and onward ôawakening a true racial consciousness that is aware of this systemic racism and that unequivocally rejects it and whiteness itself as its root is therefore the chief program of critical race theory james lindsay ôrace marxism new discourses pg 13 while critical race theory aims to raise a ôracial consciousness the tfr promoted pedagogy culturally relevant teaching aims to raise a ôcritical consciousness according to the calif dept of education cde culturally relevant teaching consists of three components all of which ômust be utilized including supporting a students ôcritical consciousness which is the ability to recognize and critique societal inequalities the term ôcritical consciousness comes from the brazilian marxist paulo freire and is designed to create marxist political activists by engaging in marxist thought reform see ôthe marxification of education social and emotional learning sel also makes an appearance in the cmf tfr ch 13 strands of sel such as transformational sel and others also derive from marxism according to new discourses the tfr also includes elements from gender ideology and a section on ôteaching towards social justice suggesting both should be incorporated into math curriculum and instruction its not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum thats a problem its that the tfr favors ideological proposals known to lead to academic failure and its also that these ideologies if implemented in public school would contravene a number of state and federal laws and constitutional provisions see kathryn jordan public comment on the tfr the
-1	the framework lacks clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 which will harm stem majors  
-1	the cmf is repeating the failed removal of phonics experiment but now with math neuroscience showed us that learning phonics is vital and should not be subjugated to social emotional learning the ultimate irony was a reference in cmf to an fmri study that compared 15 students with and 15 students without math learning disability that used the cmf 2013 techniques and showed brain activity normalized in students with math learning disabilities here is the quote one study conducted by neuroscientists in stanfords school of medicine examined the effects of a tutoring intervention with students who had been diagnosed as having mathematics learning disabilities and those with no identified difficulties in mathematics luculano et al 2015 prior to the intervention the group of students with identified learning disabilities had lower mathematics performance and different brain activation patterns than students who had no identified difficulties in mathematics after eight weeks of oneonone tutoring focused on strengthening student understanding of relationships between and within operations not only did both sets of students demonstrate comparable achievement but they also activated the same brain areas luculano et al 2015 since the brain is always developing in relation to the experiences people are engaged in welldesigned and focused math experiences support the development of pathways in the brain that enable all students to access and engage productively in the content the tutoring program in this study was described in the appendix of the paper and it extensive and followed the 2013 framework guidance the conclusion of the authors was wrong the authors demonstrated that the two groups differed less after the training and there was no evidence of any development of new brain pathways in the students with learning disabilities furthermore to claim anything about all students on the basis of a tiny group of 15 students with learning disabilities it is unclear why the term is in quotes almost as if authors questioned the diagnosis speaks to the difficulty these writers have in interpreting brain science they need an expert in brain science to advise them  
1	re letter of support for the 2023 mathematics framework dear president darlinghammond and members of the state board of education i ma bernadette andressalgarino am writing to express my wholehearted support for the revised mathematics framework as the presidentelect of the ca mathematics council board member of todos mathematics for all and a member of math cfcc i am committed to advocating for a highquality mathematics education that propels the success of all students in college career and life the revised mathematics framework is a significant step in addressing the urgent need to improve mathematics teaching and learning it strongly emphasizes equity and excellence recognizing and celebrating students diverse backgrounds genders races cultures religions and achievements furthermore it outlines clear strategies to ensure that every student receives the necessary support and challenges to thrive in their chosen pathways to success a key strength of the revised mathematics framework is its studentcentered approach it provides comprehensive guidance to educators in establishing a system of support that aligns with rigorous focused and coherent standards as exemplified through the big ideas by centering on students the framework fosters engagement and ownership of learning empowering students to become active participants in their mathematical journey i am particularly enthusiastic about the frameworks emphasis on expanding access to joyful and relevant mathematics through data science for tk  12 by equipping students with the knowledge understanding and skills to use data as a tool for mathematical reasoning and problemsolving the revised mathematics framework ensures that students are prepared to navigate the increasingly datadriven world this focus on data science will enhance students critical thinking and analytical abilities enabling them to make informed decisions and contributions to society equally important is the frameworks dedication to inclusivity and belonging it provides strategies to support diverse learners including multilingual learners students with disabilities and students from historically marginalized communities this commitment to inclusivity ensures that all students have equitable access to highquality mathematics education fostering a sense of belonging and creating opportunities for success as a parent and an experienced educator i implore the state board of education to adopt the 2023 mathematics framework this framework empowers students and their families maximizing opportunities for growth and development california cannot afford to wait any longer we must take bold action to propel our children forward and enable them to thrive for these compelling reasons i wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework thank you for your attention on this critical matter sincerely ma bernadette andressalgarino presidentelect california mathematics council  
-1	california math curricula should follow common sense approaches to avoid our continuing substandard test results

-1	ch 12 p4l74 when anxious the working memoryñthe part of the brain needed for reproducing mathematics factsñis compromised wrong overlearning facts and testing knowledge helps whereas the 2013 framework advocated for a mix of rote learning to support development of fluency and problemsolving in instruction in this revised framework there is much discussion about how rote learning is a problem and that assessment and math education must instead focus on testing complex reasoning problems to avoid disadvantaging people with math anxiety in fact this is the opposite of what is best for students with high math anxiety this was demonstrated long ago as the anxietytocomplexity effect faust ashcroft and fleck 1996 the more difficult or complex the arithmetic problem the more disadvantaged high maths anxious subjects are in terms of either speed of processing or accuracy yes working memory that supports mental flexibility needed for reasoning problems is vulnerable to distraction and anxiety but retrieval of facts depends on a different mental process semantic or declarative memory not working memory reproducing mathematics facts if heavily overlearned will likely make student performance more resilient against math anxiety during testing having a strong conceptual representation depends on learning which involves both rehearsal of arbitrary facts as well as learning conceptual relationships but to dismiss as unimportant an entire approach to learning notably practice is as unwise as cutting out part of our brains chunking is an example of how our limited capacity working memory system benefits from facts working memory capacity is typically limited to 5 elements  or ð 2 imagine holding in mind a short series of letters one has just heard a g r z or repeating those letters in reverse alphabetical order z r g a that is working memory one can vastly expand working memory capacity for holding in mind letters with arbitrary facts of how to spell words linked to knowledge eg if one groups letters into the words apple green red zero17 letters held in mind the same principles are used in other fields musicians learn scales and arpeggios they practice to automaticity and these patterns enable them to play more fluently baseball pitchers and other ballsports learn procedures to throw balls a high speeds riding a bicycle involves procedural fluency in the mechanics of the device to enable navigation to new places similarly math relies on multiple mental processes that require fluency if one has to figure out why 224 then then this process will compete for this limited capacity of working memory lack of practice to automaticity for students with math anxiety may indeed lead to those students having trouble retrieving facts but this would instead be due to inadequate instruction and this situation is what the framework is advocating

1	dr linda darlinghammond and the members of the california state board of education california needs to do more to meet the mathematics learning needs of all students this draft mathematics framework when implemented with integrity will challenge all of us as it should to stretch and grow and learn for the benefit of our students and their futures this framework communicates we are paying attention to the data and listening to the voices of all students including our most vulnerable as a grandparent retired high school math teacher from ap calculus through alternative education coach for new math teachers and member of the 2013 ca math framework committee i support the 2023 revised draft mathematics framework as recommended by the california department of education i urge you to adopt this framework as presented i shared my vision for mathematics learning at one of the 2019 focus group meetings i was not alone the sbe listened to suggestions from myself and others and approved guidelines that address the needs of all students and clarifies and builds upon the previous framework through both public reviews i continued to share my thoughts concerns and appreciation as an individual and as a member of caring math educator communities i signed the california math councils letter of support along with hundreds 2800 of others some highlights of this framework for me to name a few of many  support for all learners  guiding principles toward equity in mathematics instruction ch 1 p 11  five components of instructional design ch 2 pp 10   assetsbased approach to instruction ch 2 p 8  support for meaningful mathematics including cultural and personal relevance ch 2 p 11  emphasis on big ideas and coherence across grades ch 1 pp 1518 ch 2 p 13  designing instruction with integration in mind ch 8 p 25 54  rigorous pathways in addition to the common precalculuscalculus pathway with more choices for third and fourthyear courses ch 8 pp 2931  elevate realworld application of mathematics understanding ch 8 p 32  reasoning with data ch 1 p 24 the challenge to create an advisory guiding document that is exactly what all stakeholders desire is an impossible task this is an excellent document all of the persons involved in this monumental task of creating this forwardthinking document should be commended for their diligence in following the guidelines approved by the state board in 2019 and be thanked for their huge investment of time for the benefit of all students respectfully submitted bruce grip  
-1	 the cmfs vision of teaching math will harm our black and brown students  
-1	students need to be challenged and taught mathematics and stem we should borrow from other states and countries in their successful programs instead of inventing our own math light social sciences heavy method with questionable data to back up we are putting our state and our childrens future at risk over a feel good pet project   
-1	please bring algebra back to 8th grade the lack of algebra is the only reason we are considering leaving sfusd for private school   
-1	dear state board of education firstly thank you for your hard work and dedication toward improving math achievement for our students were on the same team with that said i strongly believe the board should reject the proposed math framework my three main reasons 1 tom loveless the accomplished education researcher policy author of 16 volumes of the brown center report on american education summarized the main concerns about the frameworks severe lack of quality research in his writing here   the part that stood out to me the most was the 2022 california math framework does not reflect current scholarship on how to serve students who struggle when learning mathematics a search of studies cited in a recent what works clearinghouse publication assisting students struggling with mathematics intervention in the elementary grades reveals absolutely no overlap  the process employed to search literature and select evidence for the frameworks recommendations is unknown 2 in january 2022 one of the frameworks coauthors katy early gave a presentation titled teaching to big ideas to our districts elementary staff one concern was that she distributed an article which as a district we took time to discuss that denigrated timed math fluency practice however timed math fluency practice has strong evidence according to the federal what works clearinghousess practice guide on assisting struggling math students   the article she distributed mentioned anxiety related to timed math fluency practice but the truth is no studies have determined that timed tests cause math anxiety  defined as feelings of apprehension tension or fear that may interfere with performance on mathrelated tasksa in fact timed tactics improve math performanceb according to the experts at science of math group   i asked katy about the research behind the framework and her answer wasnt much beyond its got research behind it the result was some of our staff were convinced we should not have math fact expectations or timed fluency practice anymore this is sad and frustrating and bad for our kids the framework wields immediate influence to the detriment of our students 3 my final reason is presented as a set of questions for decisionmakers such as yourself and these come from amanda vanderheyden who is part of the science of math group what do university mathematics professors think of the revised framework not math ed professors but mathematics and more broadly stem professors what evidence do you have from wellcontrolled experimental studies that these revisions will produce benefits to students where are the field trials that have been through peerreview and show benefit what are the measured costs or sideeffects what are the effects on learning for students from various backgrounds and starting skill levels what are the operationalized training models that will equip teachers to deliver the new framework with sufficient integrity what evidence can you show from rigorous research studies demonstrating that your manualized training systems will equip teachers to implement who advised changing both the instructional scheme your independent variable and your measurement scheme your dependent variables and measures at the same time this is basic science 101 and doing this means that ca students rights are not being protected what is the alignment of the instruction targets methods and assessments proposed in the new framework with the last 30 years of policy guidance and funded federal research eg the ies practice guides in mathematics that summarize research evidence national panels where are the voices  citations of the wellregarded substantive researchers in mathematical learning from all branches of psychology from mathematics from special education thank you for your time in reading this   
-1	after reading the proposed framework i am vehemently opposed and recommend a full reassessment of the states approach to mathematics education in this draft we find no measurable goals or performance indicators nothing pertaining to actually mathematics education or approaches to learning and a deep lack of rigor in anything one would call academic instead we are drenched with inclusive language that while may feel like a fair and respectful way to educate does not apply to math nor serves our student body do not approve this i repeat do not approve this our state has woefully low maths comprehension and we owe it to our students to provide a foundation of true understanding in this subject its embarrassing that this document was produced by a group tasked with improving the educational frameworks of our state i repeat do not approve   
1	as the president of the orange county mathematics council and a stem coordinator for 23 ca elementary schools i am writing to you to share my support for the adoption of the 2023 ca math framework the focus on equity and antitracking is of particular importance in fact every professional development conference i have been to in the last few years whether locally or at the state or even national level has focused on the issue of equity in math education not only do many of our ca students need equitable math instruction and opportunities to succeed but they deserve it as educators we must meet the needs of our changing population of every single one of our students and this framework sets teachers up to do exactly that in addition i had the honor of being a part of the framework committee for the state as those who were in the room for the discussions know the educators involved in this process were knowledgeable highly respected in the field of math education and advocates for students of all races achieving at every level the process was sound and the words in the framework agreed upon we have known without a doubt that this framework would improve student experiences increase learning and set students up for a successful future as critical thinkers please with all of our ca students in mind approve the math framework for our state if we want more of our children to succeed this is the guiding document that can allow that achievement to happen thank you   
-1	this is the wrong approach for math california students are struggling in math and this is not going to help but will actually push them backward farther there are excellent math textbooks and teachers in california at the art of problem solving every student should learn math the way aops presents it wed have the best math scores in the nation if we took that approach and not this new approach concocted by people out of touch with what actual student needs   
1	i am writing to support the inclusion of chapter 5 mathematical foundations for data science a growing evidence base suggests significant value for k12 data science programs and their positive impact on students trajectories while these programs may appear new they build upon a strong foundation of education research and learning science literature stretching back over a decade between 2013 and 2018 national science foundation grants supported the development of high school data science courses curricula and k12 classroom software today over 70 classroom resources are available for k12 data science education in 2019 an international consortium of researchers published the idssp framework   forwarding a common framework for standalone high school courses across countries in 2021 the institute of education sciences released a technical working group for k12 data science education that highlighted significant opportunities for student engagement greater diversity in stem education and additional research opportunities to forward the field in my capacity as a former researcher for the us department of educations institute of education sciences ies i helped to gather evidence and diverse research expertise for this report all which demonstrated significant potential value for students mathematics learning if scaled in 2022 the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine released their first national proceedings that cataloged a diverse array of k12 data science programs around the country the report and commissioned papers highlighted the uniquely strong student engagement positive identity formation and rigorous mathematical thinking that students gain from diverse curriculum programs around the country ð gathered through over 60 fieldsubmitted casestudies educator interviews and 6 expert panel discussions over two days i am writing to share an additional research evaluation on high school data science course programs in california attached that show relative gains for student attitudes toward mathematics interest in stem confidence in stem skills and greater math coursetaking when given the opportunity to enroll in a high school data science course this study is prepublication and still subject to peer review but we are sharing now given the forthcoming framework decision deadline we believe this is yet another indication among many that k12 data science programs have strong potential to bring students into stem pathways who would not otherwise consider these options ð providing students the motivation to learn additional mathematics in high school and higher education that is required for stem degree programs the revised framework is a first step toward building content equity in ensuring students have access to a variety of advanced 21st century mathematics options i fully support the departments adoption of the proposed chapter 5 addition  
-1	first of all i cant believe such a short comment period was provided and over a holiday weekend must be intentional to avoid feedback california should look at states with the highest scores in math to implement a new program there needs to be much more drilling and repetition in our math programs like there used to be here we go againéthe main focus is equityéthere is no way to measure success equity only deals with fairness it should be samenesséthere is only one correct answer for a math problem kids dont have to be focused on student identity developmentéwe should just be teaching math math is a non political subject and it seems the state is making it one i say discard this proposed framework completely and develop a new one based on those proven successful check out idaho utah and massachusetts for starters  
-1	ideology is theory the fundamentals of mathematics is needs to be taught first without propaganda this is not an investment on learning nor teaching but an investment on rhetoric   
-1	this is a disgrace to our state and our students california is already behind in education and this will make us sink to the bottom equity means bringing everyone down to the lowest level that is not promoting all students to be proficient in math that is promoting no students being proficient while this reduces our students viability in college and the workplace it also reduces their ability to be successful in life our own colleges will be skipping over our students for ones from other states who are qualified if students do go to college with this type of education they will drop out we already have a high number of students that do not finish college because they were not prepared the solution is not to under prepare thwm even more there is a mass exodus out of california and it will get bigger if this plan passes then you will not even have enough students in some areas to keep schools open you need to scrap this plan and look at other states that are leading the way in this field and do that the farther behind our students fall equals the farther behind our state falls vote no  
-1	its concerning that this new framework relies heavily on inaccurate disputed data reputable leaders in the math profession like prof jelani nelson at ucb and many others have pointed out the flaws with the data and framework  ironically the new framework uses applesorange comparisons to attempt to show better educational outcomes when probed with accurate review of the data the principles of the framework actually worsened student outcomes the goal of improving math literacy will not be met with this framework rejecting is in the best interest of ca students   
-1	the california math framework was written by curriculum developers who stand to financially benefit from being included for example it promotes the youcubed curriculumé which was created by jo boaler one of the original authors of the cmfé and which has never been evaluated in a peerreviewed study this is a blatant conflict of interest even worse the framework lets districts deny bright kids the opportunity to take algebra in 8th grade ñ which is a standard option most places on the planet in sf removing 8th grade algebra led to privileged parents finding workarounds or leaving public schoolsé while kids with no options fell behind their peers in neighboring districts and the performance of black and latino kids hasnt materially improved ñ in fact the performance gap has widened it has taken 10 years of advocacy to get the policy reversed still working on it and thats thousands of schoolchildren we left behind please dont let other districts make our mistake every 8th grader should have access to algebra if theyre ready for it thank you  
1	adopt national teachers of mathematics standards k12 in addition reinstate that public school teachers signed affidavit the they are not a member of communist party as a condition of employment   
-1	this framework should be rejected because it fails science technology engineering and math stem students and especially harms socioeconomically disadvantaged students the math pathway diagram the framework guides for is stated in chapter 8 line 701 figure 84 below indicates possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade the figure 84 is shown in the pdf attachment this figure which represents the math course diagram the framework is guiding for california places the taking of algebra i or mathematics i in 9th grade and with a common ninth and tenthgrade experience this means for all students the failure of this math pathway diagram for stem students is described in an open letter from the stem community the link for this letter is one of the links this article hyperlinks to   this math pathway diagram fails stem students because it places significant roadblocks and obstacles in the path of students hoping to reach ap calculus in high school the above article describes that in the end this especially harms students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds because these students rely solely on the public school for education if the public school system does not offer opportunities to students they do not get them families with resources can find alternatives outside the public school system leaving families without resources behind for this reason as warned by stem professionals in an open letter this could lead to a de facto privatization of advanced mathematics k12 education and disproportionately harm students with fewer resources why would we guide california to adopt the policies that fail stem students and especially harm students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds this framework must be rejected  
-1	the framework should be rejected because it is guiding districts to adopt policies of a district that has demonstrably failed its students the framework recommends in chapter 8 line 701 figure 84 below indicates possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade the figure 84 is shown in the pdf attachment this figure which represents the math course diagram the framework is guiding for california places the taking of algebra i or mathematics i in 9th grade and with a common ninth and tenthgrade experience this means for all students this math course pathway diagram is essentially the same as san francisco unified school district sfusd both of these policies are already occurring at sfusd which also has as its basis a policy which delays algebra i until 9th grade for all students just as the framework guides for this is well known to the writers of the framework as they explicitly referenced sfusd in their first draft but removed mention of it in the subsequent drafts after it was pointed to them that the success claims of sfusd were misrepresented disregarding this although mention of sfusd was removed with regard to the math pathway diagram it is clear that the math pathway diagram recommended by the framework is substantially similar to that of sfusd as shown in the attachment both the framework and sfusd have only one path for students before 11th grade and delay algebra i until 9th grade for all students studies of sfusd show that achievement gaps are widening sfusd is headed in the wrong direction on equity and fewer students reach ap calculus than before the links for these studies are 1   2   the reality of sfusd is that sfusd families not sitting idly by while their students careers are compromised resort to workarounds this can be read about in this link   sadly these workarounds are often paytoplay meaning families without resources are left floundering with substandard alternatives like taking two math classes simultaneously losing desirable electives as warned by stem professionals in an open letter this could lead to a de facto privatization of advanced mathematics k12 education and disproportionately harm students with fewer resources why would we guide california to adopt the policies of a district that demonstrably failed this framework must be rejected  
-1	my son benefitted from math acceleration starting min middle school he was able to complete all community college math classes by the end of high school this gave him an opportunity to take upper level math classes in college and transfer enough credits to be able to get the bs im physics in three years while saving on tuition i hate to think that kids who love math will not have this opportunity   
-1	the new proposed math framework is an abomination just teach math my daughter will not be enrolling her 4 year old daughter in public school since everything taught there is so politicized i agree with everything palos verdes peninsula school board member julie hamill said below f i were in charge of creating a new math framework i would look to places where children are excelling in math and borrow their strategies massachusetts utah and idaho have the highest naep scores in math first generation chinese immigrants in our community explained to me the drilling and repetition they learned in school and wonder why we cannot implement the same here ð because it works instead californias proposed framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords light on actual math it reads like an instructional manual on social justice ð not how to teach math while this may appeal to those who identify with the far left it repels everyone else and fails the goal of actually teaching math the stated focus is equity ð for which there are no measurable objective benchmarks in fact i did not find anything in the framework regarding how to measure success the framework defines equity as fairness in education rather than samenessequity includes four dimensions in mathematics education 1 access to tangible resources 2 participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them 3 student identity development in mathematics and 4 attention to relations of power first of all  sameness is important in math there is only one correct answer to a mathematical problem that is how math works secondly  do kids really need to be focused on student identity development in math or attention to relations of power can we not just teach everyone math this is objectively insane to me from the overview the goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all california students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldñin their careers in college and in civic life from chapter 1 reflecting the states commitment to equity every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2 9 and 10 the framework is also focused on environmental literacy ð which has nothing to do with learning math in summary the horse is out of the barn on this framework and i dont think anything can be done to change course we have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of cde they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas my recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful ð like those in massachusetts utah idaho and china for starters instead our government has taken a nonpolitical subject ð math ð heavily politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for equity ð whatever that means here is the framework  public comments due tomorrow july 7 at noon here  as always this is just one ladys opinion i do not speak for the board and no one else speaks for me  
1	i urge the ca state board to accept the current draft of the 2023 ca mathematics framework i agree with the premise that students should develop habits of mind and habits of interaction described in the standards for mathematical practicei approve of the frameworks approach which includes real world examples and use of data in problem solving i agree that students benefit from opportunities to explicitly connect conceptual understanding with facts and procedures in ways that make sense to them it is crucial for educators to encourage mathematical growth in students so that they can persevere in learning beginning arithmetic and computation and advance to abstract subjects in algebra and geometry we need this framework to help classroom teachers deliver both basic concepts and math fact instruction and prepare our students to succeed in higher levels of mathematics thank you  
-1	the cmf is repeating the failed removal of phonics experiment but now with math  
-1	i was happy to see revisions from the previous framework however i am disappointed that the framework still does not support a pathway to algebra in 8th grade appendix a mathematical progressions within the high school pathways clearly places algebra in 9th grade however it is imperative to get to calculus a prior to college for physics math or engineering majors which requires either algebra in 9th grade our doubling up on math in high school i majored in physics in college and those students that had not had calculus prior to college had major problems thank you  
-1	this is not math this is offensive our kids are already behind the rest of the nation this would be detrimental to their education and will only leave them further behind  
-1	there should be no restrictions on teaching algebra based on age 
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors  
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians  
-1	i oppose the proposed california math framework version 3 in particular i do not support weakening the requirement that third graders master multiplication multiplication accuracy must be continuously stressed in 3rd grade or else students will not be ready for division fractions and decimals in 4th and 5th grades automaticity in addition subtraction multiplication and division is vital for understanding prealgebra and pregeometry you cannot skip the 4 operations which are the building blocks of math permitting young students to use calculators during math in elementary or middle school is the essence of irresponsibility also 8th grade algebra should be offered in every middle school without 8th grade algebra students cannot take calculus in 12th grade without workarounds such as summer school doubling up etc this is not fair to students who are ready to take algebra by 8th grade there should be high dosage tutoring offered at every ca public school during regular school hours so that c or worse students who fall behind have help it should be mandatory dont let students fall soo far behind do not water down math standards is it equity when high school students graduate without a firm grasp of arithmetic or algebra 1 is it equity when they must take remedial math at community college which includes arithmetic and algebra 1 is it equity when stem careers are closed to them because they never mastered arithmeticalgebra 1  
-1	the framework should be rejected because the policies it is recommending california adopt violate education codes the framework recommends in chapter 8 line 701 figure 84 below indicates possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade education codes edc 512247 edc 512282 and edc 512245 clearly articulate that 1 9th grade math course placement is recognized as being very important in the careers of students 2 it is expected that the math course placement of one student will differ from the next this is obvious because if it was not then there would be no need for a math placement act if a common ninth and tenthgrade experience was expected there would be no need to be concerned with placing students in different classes there would be no need for a math placement act as students would all be having a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and be placed in the same class that is there would be no need to place students in different classes the law dictates students should be placed in different classes based on their proficiency and have an experience substantially different than some other students and specifically as dictated by law not a common ninth and tenthgrade experience 3 fair and objective testing is required by law to be used to determine which course the student is to be properly placed in this means it is expected that the placement of one student will be different from the next and a student is allowed to demonstrate which class heshe is to be properly placed in by performance on a test among other methods this makes it illegal for districts to place all students in the same class which would be to impose a common ninth and tenthgrade experience on its students  since this framework is guiding districts to impose an illegal policy on its students the framework must either 1 clearly explain to districts that this is illegal 2 excise from the framework the parts of the framework that guide districts towards this illegal policy that is remove the phrase a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and all guidance associated with it 3 not adopt the framework the state board of education must vote to not adopt the framework since the illegality of this wording in the framework has been present in all three drafts and this has been clearly pointed out to the writers of the framework in public comment it is clear that this wording is both the intention of the framework writers and that they continue to write this disregarding the knowledge of its illegality this shows complete and utter negligence on the part of the framework writers a dereliction of duty and therefore the best solution is for the framework to not be adopted and for the writing of the framework be started over from scratch by a group of writers that are willing to not guide districts to invoke policies that break the law  
-1	i have two children in california public schools and we are seriously considering leaving the state if math and other core subjects keep being altered to fit ideological rules to the detriment of education  
-1	i dont think we have to rush to change our math framework rapidly and drastically being progressive does not mean that we have to change everything that has been working well i am concern that a focus on social justice is replacing a focus on mastering math itself in this proposal   
-1	this is not a solution to the problem of underprivileged students not receiving a quality education this is merely removing the option for some kids to better educate themselves in the name of diversity which in the end wont even benefit the students you want to be inclusive of please come up with a better solution to help these students and not tear down existing infrastructure that provides advanced education to kids who can benefit from this i say this as someone who took advanced math and high school and was able to use the experience to help me find my eventual occupation  
-1	this framework has an inadequate focus on the evaluation and goal of math proficiency math builds on itself so that without assuring mastery of each topic students are unprepared thus proficiency must be the goal not just enhancing learning or positive mathematics identities standardized tests are most effective at evaluating proficiency to supplement these tests some measures allow for after the formal assessment on can test limits deviating from standard procedures gathering qualitative observations such as those described as formative assessment by doing this after formal testing you get both my submission keeps getting blocked and i dont know why but i have attached the full statement which is under 3000 characters it may be that i have provided websites for the ethical standards for educational and psychological testing that are not cited in the framework or adhered to in your 60 page chapter on assessment or anywhere else that i could find that is negligence competent assessment is crucial for guiding how to teach individual students

-1	equity does not mean uniformity equity means equal access and support for all there are people who will write more eloquently than i have time to do given the short window created for public response to this overhaul of california mathematics but i want to be clear we used the big ideas textbooks in my childrens middle school this past year and the students fell so far behind peers in other schools using more traditional textbooks that the our children began panicking all were forced to use on line platforms to teach themselves the material at home in their limited free time using their precious free time which should be dedicated to extra curriculars family homework or relaxation to learn the basics of geometry given that the big ideas textbook was so remedial repetitive and insufficient the new framework is not based on data driven research it has been uniformly criticized by experts in mathematics and teachers i dedicate my volunteer hours to increase equity and access for tsp students in accelerated gifted pathways we need to improve very early education and gifted identification we need to allow our accelerated learners  from all economic cultural and racial backgrounds to have the support and encouragement they need in order to fulfill their potential the problems we face as a world are going to require great minds with advanced educations we need stem innovators we need students who are radically accelerated in mathematics and all sciences our planet is broken and we need to build a generation of thinkers inventors and creators we cannot do that by believing that equity equals uniformity we must allow athletes to succeed in athletics just as we allow mathematicians to succeed in mathematics we dont cripple our fastest runners and it is undathomable to me that we celebrate a gymnastics prodigy but want to bridle and restrain a math whiz this is anti intellectualism at its worst and most insidious im sure you are aware mathematicians do their greatest work in their 20s and early 30s we cannot hobble our youth by preventing them from accelerating in math if that is something that they are willing interested and able to do we will drive our brightest into the private school sector furthermore we will radicalized parents and send them to the far right we are already seeing the catastrophic affects of the radical right in much of california however initiatives like the california math framework will push moderates to the right sadly only the right seems to be their ally in this argument and that is devastating it will have a ripple effect into politics as well all because california is taking the advice of a woman who should not only not be listened to but who should be criticized and dismissed for her lack of ethics in misrepresenting data and parading opinion as fact will we stop young children from reading novels if they are inclined to do so this is seeming very brave new world to me the new math framework is an embarrassment to california we are already lagging many behind many other countries in stem this new framework will aggravate the problem the fact that you are listening to the advice of someone who seems to be inclined to be promoting her own textbooks and opeds instead of listening to the hundreds of mathematicians and stem professionals telling you that this is bad research is deeply troubling to me acceleration works that fact is backed up by research across the board tracking may or may not always work but radical acceleration produces phdôs it produces patents it produces scientists this is proven denying acceleration to gifted children destroys their passion for education and it is cruel we need to offer the opportunity to accelerate to all of our students and we need to improve math education for those who are not accelerated most students dont need calculus perhaps we need to rethink that but we certainly need many of our students to learn calculus in order to succeed in fields that require it and if those students want to learn calculus in fourth grade 8th grade 10th gradeñterrific we need those kids theyre going to fix the world

of whole numbers by unit fractions eg by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem guess what big idea these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under did you guess shapes on a plane neither did i as there is no connection here v algebra i investigate situations that involve linear quadratic and exponential models and use these models to solve problems recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval interpret the inverse of functions and model the inverse in graphs tables and equations this standard can be found under the content connection of putting wholes together and taking whole apart why would nearly anything in algebra i fit into the same 4 categories focused on in kindergarten apparently for consistency as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards the cmf states ch 8 line 77 for consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span the expected understandings skills and dispositions of graduates are organized by content connection cc _ reasoning with data cc1 _ exploring changing quantities cc2 _ taking wholes apart putting parts together cc3 _ discovering shape and space cc4 10 _ an obsession with data has taken over much of the cmf without evidence to support this drastic change as noted before data has always been additional or supporting in the standards and never major yet this cmf not only devotes an entire chapter to it but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to i can understand the desire for relevance but then why not focus on financial applications and algebra in secondary is it because the two of the authors of the big ideas have designed their own data course this is surely something to be explored by the sbe _ in chapter 5 line 231 we read there are multiple opportunities to support such datarich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band so teaching data comes before being concerned about grade level standards _ chapter 7 line 514 tells us grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about datañreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives again who is deciding this where are the math experts those with phds in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education _ there are multiple instances of the cmf describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards this blatant disregard for content standards to focus on data is not acceptable see ch 5 line 493 chapter 5 line 561 and chapter 5 line 604 for examples _ the focus on data has so clouded the cmfs thinking they describe activities with virtually no math which would be ok if ca students were proficient but since were far below math teachers need to teach math content standards we read for example students may be challenged to discover which location inside or outside the classroom has the best types of tables for collaborative group work as a part of this task students explore the idea of best and discuss features such as size of the tabletop height of the table and shape the teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsñeg of width height and shape of the table after collecting data students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeñeg trapezoids kidney beans and circles ch 5 line 700 so students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure is that the rigor we expect in ca schools in grade 5 textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed so what isnt the cmf held to the same standard _ to be eligible for adoption programs must include a welldefined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards ch

-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses like algebra being an option in grade 8 and in fact studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments thankfully the sbe did not pass that version nor the second version of the cmf and this current third version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade algebra could be an option while progress has been made i ask you to again reject this cmf and require that clear pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations as the current cmf is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students the cmf clearly wants all students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ the cmf describes heterogeneously grouped classrooms from grade school through high school ch 1 line 208 _ the cmf notes possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade ch 8 line 702 and ch 8 line 1295 note that chapter 10 line 809 reads the framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight it is obvious that there are not clear recommendations within the cmf about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8 apparently some folks working on the cmf such as was evidenced in the first field review still want no acceleration before grade 11 but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9 this confusing unclear and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a cmf that the sbe adopts 1 _ as evidence for why the us should not allow acceleration before grade 11 the cmf states another review of international evidence about tracking found that while most organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly woessmann 2009 ch 9 line 148 first it is interesting to note that other countries who are far outperforming the us in math allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10 and yet the cmf is recommending waiting until grade 11 what is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration woessmann 2009 discusses students being tracked into different schools not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school there are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a lower school than there are with the current policy in california where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced english or history this is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics students recognize often as early as kindergarten that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others do not approve a california math framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to accelerate what does nonacceleration look like _ since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11 the cmf describes what grade 10 classes should look like we read when differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students the curriculum remains similar and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus ch 8 line 467 so advanced students 13 years ahead of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below proficient in grade 8 who is the teacher really going to teach if the teacher chooses the middle which is common the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into stem fields and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind there is one vignette in the cmf that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully ch 9 beginning line
-1	i understand and share your concerns as a concerned parent citizen and 3rd generation resident of california the proposed math framework unfortunately falls short in its objectives serving political interests rather than prioritizing the excellence in math education that our children deserve it is crucial that we steer ourselves towards quantifiable goals such as the naep math assessments which provide a reliable benchmark for measuring student proficiency we should strive to achieve scores that meet or exceed results from kids in massachusetts utah and idaho regrettably the current framework lacks the necessary clarity and foresight i implore you to reconsider and adopt an alternative framework that places a strong emphasis on objectivity and measurable outcomes our primary goal should be to teach math in its purest form devoid of any political influences by doing so we can provide our children with a wellrounded education that equips them for a future filled with opportunities kids deserve a rigorous flexible math curriculum that empowers them to excel think critically and develop essential problemsolving skills through consistent routine practice regards  
-1	no antimerit statewide framework to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes this would be disastrous on the quality of public education america needs competent engineers scientists mathematicians and other stem talents more than ever we cant allow public education to keep spinning downwards stop the equitythemed math framework which is an ideological experiment on our next generation  
-1	dumbing down math is not a way to prepare our kids for the future or help our nation and state   
-1	please dont ruin math for future generations our kids are already far enough behind as it is math is not a place to teach idealism bridges dont fall down due to failed ideals they fall down due to failed math  
-1	the main failing of this draft continues to be overreliance on unproven strategies popular with the authors it would benefit from a supplemental chapter incorporating feedback from stakeholders in industry and higher education detailing how much further proficiency of californias public school students is likely to slide behind their peers in other states and parochial schools should this framework be adopted while i recognize that the guidelines provided to the committee do not prioritize providing all students the best mathematical foundation possible i strongly believe that our educational policies should strive for this goal this approach could have been balanced with a healthy dose of skepticism towards the referenced research and a commitment to scientific rigor thank you for considering my comments i urge the committee to take this opportunity to reassess and rewrite the current framework addressing the concerns raised with the objective of ensuring it serves as a model of educational excellence  
-1	please do not adopt this math framework it hurts kids of all races that want and need to be challenged it will hurt california people will move to states that offer advanced math

-1	the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability students are grouped together see chapter nine or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableñas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived ability so that students soon understand who is the high kid and who is the low kid in the group aside from

1	dr linda darlinghammond and the members of the california state board of education the leadership of the california mathematics council cmc has crafted and attached our letter of support for the revised 2023 california mathematics framework we have been actively involved throughout the development of the draft mathematics framework beginning with the providing of input at the 2019 focus group meetings several of our cmc leaders served as valuable members of the cfcc and we continued to provide extensive feedback through both rounds of public comment in addition cmc wrote a letter of support cosigned by over 2800 individuals and over 60 organizations as stated in the attached letter we recommend the ca sbe adopt the revised 2023 california mathematics framework as posted on june 26 2023 respectfully bruce c grip president california mathematics council dear members of the state board of education thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools mathematics framework this letter is signed by several of californias educational advocacy and research organizations who have been working together for over two years to ensure that the framework includes principles of equity and strategies to meet the needs of californias diverse student population we believe that the updated framework is assetbased and if implemented properly can help to close opportunity gaps in math instruction we are also pleased to see the focus on equity in pedagogical approaches to teaching math still included from the previous version therefore we write in support of approving the 2023 mathematics framework with a modification to chapter 13 that would ensure that instructional materials are aligned to english language development eld standards we thank the writers staff and members of the instructional quality commission and state board of education for incorporating many of the comments members of this coalition have provided over the past two years the updated framework offers a strong vision for math instruction that is focused on deeper learning and on ensuring there is clear support and equitable access to rigorous coursework for all students in particular we appreciate the following areas the framework emphasizes _ culturally relevant and assetbased the framework offers strategies and vignettes that can make math culturally relevant to students of color and multilingual students these include strategies for drawing on students experiences elevating the assets of linguistically diverse students and families and incorporating families in math learning the vignettes also highlight the diversity of students and offer examples of how educators can meet the needs of students with diverse learning needs _ supporting english learners the framework offers guidance on supporting english learners and leveraging the language assets of students we support references to the english language artseld framework eld standards strategies and scaffolds to support english learners els and assessment considerations however there is still an area of opportunity to add language to chapter 13 category 1 mathematics contentalignment with the standards lines 251275 that would make alignment to eld standards a key feature for instructional materials please see letter submitted on june 6 that discusses this recommendation in more detail understanding that a framework serves as guidance to the field we also emphasize the following areas of focus moving forward that would ensure the promise within the framework is achieved _ opportunity to provide high quality instructional materials leas still need additional guidance and support for ensuring they adopt high quality instructional materials therefore we hope that guidance from the framework can be elaborated on and additional support provided to support leas in their adoption process it is our hope that within the state adoption process the selected reviewers come with various areas of expertise in meeting the needs of our highestneed students including english learners students with disabilities and students of color similar guidance about the areas of expertise that leas should include in their review processes should also be provided to the field tools and resources that can help meet the needs of highneed students should also be incorporated within the state and lea adoption processes for example there are rubrics and tools available that should be incorporated such as criteria for review of instructional materials success in addressing mll linguistic and instructional needs which was recently published by the california curriculum collaborative _ support for implementation while the framework remains long it does include many evidencebased instructional practices that can benefit leas schools and educators therefore we hope that the state provides additional resources and supports to ensure the rich guidance in the framework reaches the field and multiple audiences including lea leaders educators and families these supports can include professional learning opportunities tools and resources county offices of education must also play an important role in providing regional support and guidance to ensure equitable implementation key areas to consider are 1 professional learning related to highleverage instructional strategies 2 support for districts in reviewing and updating policies around enrollment in rigorous math coursework and 3 systems that provide equitable access for all students without support from the state and county offices the promise included within the text of the framework cannot be achieved thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on the draft 2023 mathematics framework as always we are happy to provide additional details or answer any questions sincerely 
-1	the cmfs vision of teaching math will harm our black and brown students i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting if the cmf vision is implemented our black and brown students will suffer the most it is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life and yet black or african american and brown latino or hispanic students in california are failing math at historic rates black or african american students are down to 16 proficient or advanced on caaspp in 202122 from their high of 21 in 2019 and latino or hispanic students are down to 21 proficient or advanced in 202122 from their high of 28 in 2019 ch 2 line 54 the majority of teachers go into education to

help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups does the cmf devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students unfortunately the cmf is instead focused on ensuring these students have authentic experiences and that teachers center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics ch

all content fit within 4 content connections ccs two of which are not major according to the 2013 california content standards students with teachers who focus on these 4 ccs will lose ground compared with their peers who have teachers who ignore this advice and instead teach the content standards or those who will get tutors or outside support a in the 2013 ca math framework and also noted in the blueprint for the caaspp exam standards are labeled as the major work of the grade level or labeled as additional or supporting standards it is explained that the additionalsupporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves in all grade levels k8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers fractions decimals and integers place value algebraic thinking including expressions and equations and ratios and proportions additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data statistics or probability as well as all standards related to geometry the 4 ccs which the cmf describe as the what of teaching math are as follows 1 reasoning with data 2 exploring changing quantities 3 taking wholes apart putting wholes together and 4 discovering shape and space ch 1 line 457 1 so two of the four ccs 50 are topics which the california common core content standards for mathematics as evidenced in the 2013 ca math framework and the sbac blueprint says are not major work of any grade level how will 50 of the what of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students as the cmf says repeatedly it might be more engaging and help them develop positive math identities but this will leave them further behind the 4 ccs are then connected to big ideas which the cmf tells teachers to teach from instead of individual content standards even though some content standards such as grade 5 nbt 7 include students adding subtract multiplying decimals to the hundredths why cant a teacher spend a month or more on that major individual standard 2 the cmf focuses on engagement through authentic tasks over mastery of content a the cmf uses the phrase engaging or student engagement in reference to ensuring students are engaged by the math 120 times for comparison the use of proficiency in math content appears 11 times and mastery of math content 9 times how disappointing that the cmf is more concerned with engagement than the learning of math content standards following is a description of what engaging math is according to the authors of the cmf research shows that students achieve at higher levels when they are actively engaged in the learning process boaler 2016 cast ndeducators can increase student engagement by selecting challenging mathematics problems that invite all learners _ involve multiple content areas _ highlight contributions of diverse cultural groups _ invite curiosity _ allow for multiple approaches collaboration and representations in multiple languages and _ carry the expectation that students will use mathematical reasoning ch 6 line 170 if you have ever known or worked with a struggling math student which again is roughly 67 of all ca students and 8085 of black and brown students you know they are not engaged by challenging math problems they do not have time to work on multiple content areas when so far behind and highlighting contributions of diverse cultural groups does not make the learning of the math any easier b the cmf uses the phrase authentic to describe the types of tasks they want teachers to create or use 109 times again compare this with the 11 times proficiency in math appears the 9 times mastery of math appears or even the 71 times fluency appears of which many times the cmf discusses fluency in a negative light it is clear the cmf prioritizes
-1	this is marxist math our kids are already behind other states in the nation use the highest performing states math curriculum not this ideologicallydriven social science takeover of the hard sciences this is offensive  
-1	as a parent of 4 children ages 10 12 15 and 28 i have a firsthand account of what works educationally for children in the classroom my childrens needs have varies greatly in this area and i have spent a great amount of time in the classrooms the state of california is becoming further behind other states and countries in math yet we continue to ignore the fact common core is not the best model nor is the proposed rewriting of basic math teaching i am appalled by the changes that are being recommended its becoming so convoluted we are having a hard time determining what subject is even being taught anymore bring back the basic math model high amount of repetition in basic math facts in the younger grades sets an extremely strong foundation for later math learning keep politics and social justice out of the classrooms students are not equal academically and they never will be please do not dumb down our more aggressive learners to try to make the more challenged look better their are students that need extra help and that is ok repetition works i have done it for my children at home since the schools dont spend time on this and it has helped them tremendously  
-1	stop lowering the bar and holding back gifted math student making everyone take the same math courses in 8th grade or preventing them from taking more advanced courses is ridiculous it will only hurt those who dont have the means to access more advanced course those families that have the means or who are willing to make the sacrifice will find away to get their children more advanced work

african american students are down to 16 proficient or advanced on caaspp in 202122 from their high of 21 in 2019 and latino or hispanic students are down to 21 proficient or advanced in 202122 from

-1	i strongly disapprove of not allowing accelerated math many students are able to do algebra before 9th grade not allowing students to take higher math will hurt them in multiple ways first they will not be challenged and will be bored with the curriculum secondly they will not be prepared for higher level mathematics in college private school children will be able to take higher math earlier  the public school children will be the ones who are hurt from this policy  
-1	against it marxist is not math 
-1	 the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math this is backwards thinking   
-1	please stop with the antiintellectual social crusade teach foundational mathematics  hold students accountable have math class every day not block schedule and demand that teachers actively instruct it is incredulous that california state board of education has empowered jo boaler a fraud political activist and a nonmathematician to shape public math policy you do not care about educating children and as such you are purposefully preventing california students from positioning themselves as best they can for future success if you continue to pursue a watereddown onesizefitsall strategy you will drive high achieving students out of the public school system   
-1	a focus on social justice is replacing a focus on mastering math lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors  
-1	im a brown woman who knows her children deserve better than the soft bigotry of low expectations my children dont need to be told theyre victims who cant succeed without the assistance of racist race based ideas they deserve to be taught math by proven methods and in the speed in which they conquer the subject if it works for asian and white children it will work for us   
-1	california students are behind in math and education in general our kids need curriculum that supports getting them caught up they need the curriculum to be created by professional mathematicians in a way that they are able to build on and understand not just memorize maybe look at other schools across the county and beyond  at how they teach math and maybe learn something about their process    
-1	the cmf is repeating the failed removal of phonics experiment but now with math  
-1	eliminating advanced math options hurts our students and hurts our public school system it hurts the students by not allowing those who are ready and eager to move ahead to do so it removes the ability for our children to be taught at the level that is right for them we all know that one size does not fit all it forces children to trudge along killing any possible intellectual challenge for the children who want more it hurts our public school system because more and more parents will flee public education and enroll their children in independent charters parochial schools and private schools further cementing the inequities that exist in public education and the inequities of which students remain in public education and what math classes they have access to

-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors as a parent of a child currently affected by this issue i strongly oppose the position thank you kristin nugent dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses like algebra being an option in grade 8 and in fact studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments thankfully the sbe did not pass that version nor the second version of the cmf and this current third version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade algebra could be an option while progress has been made i ask you to again reject this cmf and require that clear pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations as the current cmf is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students the cmf clearly wants all students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ the cmf describes heterogeneously grouped classrooms from grade school through high school ch 1 line 208 _ the cmf notes possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade ch 8 line 702 and ch 8 line 1295 note that chapter 10 line 809 reads the framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight it is obvious that there are not clear recommendations within the cmf about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8 apparently some folks working on the cmf such as was evidenced in the first field review still want no acceleration before grade 11 but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9 this confusing unclear and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a cmf that the sbe adopts 1 _ as evidence for why the us should not allow acceleration before grade 11 the cmf states another review of international evidence about tracking found that while most organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly woessmann 2009 ch 9 line 148 first it is interesting to note that other countries who are far outperforming the us in math allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10 and yet the cmf is recommending waiting until grade 11 what is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration woessmann 2009 discusses students being tracked into different schools not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school there are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a lower school than there are with the current policy in california where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced english or history this is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics students recognize often as early as kindergarten that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others do not approve a california math framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to accelerate what does nonacceleration look like _ since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11 the cmf describes what grade 10 classes should look like we read when differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students the curriculum remains similar and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus ch 8 line 467 so advanced students 13 years ahead of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below

-1	if we are going to amend the curriculum isnshould be for the goal of making sure the student is successful currently our students are well below the grad eleven they should be let concentrate on promoting math success not ideology   
-1	i strongly oppose the new math framework it has many serious issues specifically multiple cited references are not supported by the evidence moreover existing evidence shows that adoption of cmf in sfusd led to decreased math performance and worsened inequity see   and     
-1	this is unnecessary our children are behind in math teach the basics  
1	this framework has the possibility to positively expand student learning access and experience in the math classroom for more students in ways that the current and all the past framework has limited past frameworks have historically underserved marginalized communities with the right support of teachers to implement this framework has more access points for students of variety of backgrounds that have not had the access in the past language learners bipoc women and more through equity lenses students struggle to become what they cannot see or if the material cant meet them where they are they miss out on the potential to further explore their world and become the future mathematicians that we need them to be in whatever field they chose to pursue furthermore this framework does not diminish the opportunity for students who currently excel in their math progress but it does challenge them to expand their thinking and build connections outside of math this fluency and flexibility is vital to their success too many careers are not singularly conceptually focused engineers arent just running derivatives all day this framework will challenge students to be build muscle around problem solving resiliency and mathematical processes to find solutions to complex problems

-1	i absolutely oppose this framework and think it will not serve any of our kids in this global economy   
-1	first of all the committee is trying to ram this proposal through with a public comment period just after school year ends when many people are on vacation and allowing only a shambolic 2 week review period when there are more than 1000 pages of material to be reviewed is the committee concerned about the unpopularity of the cmf that it is not willing to provide a reasonable public comment period this is akin to the white house trying to hide bad news from the public by releasing it on a friday evening second of all this cmf is baloney the framework substantially reduces the rigor of the math curriculum so students can feel good about themselves for achieving more to a lower standard this is merely creating an illusion for the students that they are achieving something when in fact they are merely falling further behind compared to other states and other countries in the world if one wants to see what a rigorous math curriculum looks like they can just get an elementary math book from singapore which is readily sold online in the united states and one can see that by the fifth grade singapore students are already at least 1 grade level farther along than the current common core standard and the cmf is reducing the rigor of the curriculum even further in the name of helping more students an a achieved with a lower standard is just illusory achievement the sense of accomplishment and belonging you are trying to instill is just as fake and no different from giving everyone who participate in a sports competition a medal merely for participating besides the concerns i have of the cmf i also have tremendous concern about how the cmf was drafted as of 2020 california is a highly diverse state with 40 latino and 15 asian the cmf was drafted with heavy input from white math education researchers who make recommendations on how math should be taught to the colored communities but these researchers have minimal exposure on actual daytoday struggles of these communities and stand to profit handsomely from their consulting on math education framework with such communities case in point jo boaler and her 5000 hr consulting with the oxnard school district that is a blatant conflict of interest and needs to be called out as highly unethical please fix the cmf by increasing the rigor of the curriculum and before that form a committee that reflects the current demographic makeup of the state sampson shen dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons
-1	i am not convinced that these standards are based on reputable research and i oppose implementing them sufficient objections have been raised by tom loveless who has a ba from uc berkeley and a phd from the university of chicago one of our nations premier research universities loveless points out that those who support implementing the new standards have based their research on studies that fail to meet scientific standards i encourage you to read his article on education next   as an educator i believe that if these standards are introduced we will see a widening achievement gap in math statewide between wealthy and poor students students with wealthy or educated parents will either purchase supplemental instruction or provide it themselves to their kids poor families stuck with an unproven and in fact harmful system will simply fall farther behind   
-1	the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math  
-1	the newly proposed cmf should be rejected the basic principles for learning math are and will remain the same  memorialization and practice one cannot excel in math without doing these things the cmf puts a lot of emphasis on feeling good about the math but students will feel good about math when they see positive results and accomplishments in their learning instead tutor the kids needing help reject reject reject  
-1	the framework gives significant selfcontradictory guidance on middle school acceleration paths that needs to be fixed before this framework can become policy these are drastic revisions required or the framework must be rejected one example is the frameworks description of a claimed middle school acceleration pathway on chapter 8 line 825 shown at the bottom where a student kai takes mathematics i and ii in junior high and mathematics iii during the first year of high school if this student is in a district with a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with mathematics i starting in 9th grade which is the district the framework guides for in their math pathway diagram figure 84 and accompanying description the district would be forcing the student to repeat classes the student is already proficient in this is illegal as defined by the education codes edc 512247 edc 512282 and edc 512245 since for a district that imposed a common ninth and tenthgrade experience on its students with math i starting in 9th grade this student kai would not be able to move on in the math pathway she is currently on because that district would have to offer a variety of classes to its 9th grade students including mathematics i mathematics ii and mathematics iii in short not a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with math i in 9th it is clear that this pathway does not exist in a district that adopts the frameworks recommendation of a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with math i in 9th grade  the framework needs to make it perfectly clear that this pathway is not possible in a district that adopts the framework and the frameworks recommendation of a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with math i in 9th a public document cannot be misleading to districts phrasing needs to be inserted at the beginning of the section to clearly clarify this to districts such that contradictory guidance is not given it needs to be amended perhaps as follows insert above ch 8 l 825 for a district that does not impose a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with math i in 9th on its students and allows multiple student pathways in grades before 11 especially those of acceleration where acceleration means enabling students to enroll in a class a grade level or in the case of the student described below two grades levels above her peers and especially in middle school in short in a district that does not adopt the framework then the following example pathway is possible the above to inserted above the framework quote c 8 l 825 repeated below the student kai is interested in robotics engineering and was able to take mathematics i and ii in junior high and mathematics iii during the first year of high school by completing precalculus in the second year kai is able to take ap calculus in the third year this enables multiple options for kais fourth year such as taking her schools data science course or a programming and data science course at the local community college multivariable calculus or other college courses it is obvious this student kai lives in a district which has accelerated math pathways in middle school this pathway of kai and a district which has a common ninth and tenthgrade experience with math i starting in 9th grade as the framework guides for are fundamentally selfcontradictory it is unacceptable to have a document that can affect so many children nationwide to be fraught with obvious inconsistencies a major revision is required or this framework must not be approved  
-1	the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting if the cmf vision is implemented our black and brown students will suffer the most it is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life and yet black or african american and brown latino or hispanic students in california are failing math at historic rates black or african american students are down to 16 proficient or advanced on caaspp in 202122 from their high of 21 in 2019 and latino or hispanic students are down to 21 proficient or advanced in 202122 from their high of 28 in 2019 ch 2 line 54 the majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students regardless of their skin color in mathematics this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards what does the cmf suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups does the cmf devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students unfortunately the cmf is instead focused on ensuring these students have authentic experiences and that teachers center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics ch 2 line 513 this is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer who thinks that will help everyone knows you get better at soccer and in our case math by learning and practicing rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of show to help them learn lets support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the caaspp following are the major ways in which the cmf will harm black and brown students 1 the cmf proposes all content fit within 4 content connections ccs two of which are not major according to the 2013 california content standards students with teachers who focus on these 4 ccs will lose ground compared with their peers who have teachers who ignore this advice and instead teach the content standards or those who will get tutors or outside support a in the 2013 ca math framework and also noted in the blueprint for the caaspp exam standards are labeled as the major work of the grade level or labeled as additional or supporting standards it is explained that the additionalsupporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves in all grade levels k8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers fractions decimals and integers place value algebraic thinking including expressions and equations and ratios and proportions additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data statistics or probability as well as all standards related to geometry the 4 ccs which the cmf describe as the what of teaching math are as follows 1 reasoning with data 2 exploring changing quantities 3 taking wholes apart putting wholes together and 4 discovering shape and space ch 1 line 457 1 so two of the four ccs 50 are topics which the california common core content standards for mathematics as evidenced in the 2013 ca math framework and the sbac blueprint says are not major work of any grade level how will 50 of the what of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students as the cmf says repeatedly it might be more engaging and help them develop positive math identities but this will leave them further behind the 4 ccs are then connected to big ideas which the cmf tells teachers to teach from instead of individual content standards even though some content standards such as grade 5 nbt 7 include students adding subtract multiplying decimals to the hundredths why cant a teacher spend a month or more on that major individual standard 2 the cmf focuses on engagement through authentic tasks over mastery of content a the cmf uses the phrase engaging or student engagement in reference to ensuring students are engaged by the math 120 times for comparison the use of proficiency in math content appears 11 times and mastery of math content 9 times how disappointing that the cmf is more concerned with engagement than the learning of math content standards following is a description of what engaging math is according to the authors of the cmf research shows that students achieve at higher levels when they are actively engaged in the learning process boaler 2016 cast ndeducators can increase student engagement by selecting challenging mathematics problems that invite all learners _ involve multiple content areas _ highlight contributions of diverse cultural groups _ invite curiosity _ allow for multiple approaches collaboration and representations in multiple languages and _ carry the expectation that students will use mathematical reasoning ch 6 line 170 if you have ever known or worked with a struggling math student which again is roughly 67 of all ca students and 8085 of black and brown students you know they are not engaged by challenging math problems they do not have time to work on multiple content areas when so far behind and highlighting contributions of diverse cultural groups does not make the learning of the math any easier b the cmf uses the phrase authentic to describe the types of tasks they want teachers to create or use 109 times again compare this with the 11 times proficiency in math appears the 9 times mastery of math appears or even the 71 times fluency appears of which many times the cmf discusses
-1	you need to reject the proposed cmf it moves away from teaching math using timeproven methods in favor of untested theoretical approaches which will harm black and brown students causing more harm to the disadvantaged students please provide more tutoring to those who are falling behind   
-1	math needs to be cut and dry pure memorization we need to follow other states and countries that are doing well in math we dont need to impose politics and discussions about equity into teaching math stick with the basics our math scores are so poor its a disadvantage to our children i oppose the proposed method   
-1	no 
-1	please scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful ð like those in massachusetts utah idaho and china for starters this framework has taken a nonpolitical subject ð math ð heavily politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for equity ð whatever that means please stick with the subject rather than pushing politics on children  
-1	california needs to stop politicizing mathematics instruction and focus on giving students solid math skills early before third grade but certainly by fifth so they have a hope of pursuing more advanced math in the middle and hs grades this framework puts too much effort into soft skills engagement cultural relevance and other issues that better belong in other disciplines and it is going to cost ca and the nation dearly we will never know how much mathematical genius we have squandered and hindered with this framework aimed at math appreciation rather than mastery equity rather than efficacy and politics rather than proficiency please do not adopt this framework   
-1	math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians see attachment  
-1	my eldest son a person of color grew up here in serra mesa a neighborhood in san diego where our local high school kearny is 89 nonwhite until just recently when i began working fulltime we were a lowincome workingclass family i set the context because i am appalled and saddened that california would want to punish someone like my son who was identified as profoundly gifted at age 6 he adored math and began algebra at age 8 moving into geometry in 4th grade and calculus in middle school imagine if he was held back because of low expectations i would have crushed his intellectual curiosity instead i let him fly pursuing what he loved and he graduated from mit 7 years ago debtfree because mit was so generous with needbased aid as an expublic school teacher who saw the writing on the wall early with my son i chose to homeschool him because i knew he would be subjected to the bigotry of low expectations in public school we need to raise the bar for all children but perhaps most particularly students from underrepresented groups lowing math standards would be a disaster california public education is already near the bottom of the country in results weve strayed away from excellence in education and from teaching academics please please dont make it worse the public school will continue to lose students unless it focuses on actually educating and helping disadvantaged students rise to the occasion rather than pulling everyone down with low expectations  
-1	im a chemical engineer in a stem field and the push to get away from more traditional math programs is unproven and setting ca back i supplement math outside of school for my children as i can see the currant content leaves massive gaps in competence and the new math framework makes it worse children coming out of this program would be an at extreme disadvantage in a stem major or stem career an equitable plan would involve boosting the youngest struggling learners up not lowering the bar and exchanging solid math ability for ôbig ideas and thinking it seems that this framework was designed by people who have never used advanced math in their professions   
-1	stop proposing frameworks that gut math you are destroying public education in ca   
-1	lack of accelerated classes before 11th grade will hurt stem majors  
-1	algebra should be promoted for 8th graders who are ready for it and any curriculum should be peerreviewed and there should be no conflicts of interest  
-1	i am writing to oppose the adoption of the 2023 math framework despite being toned down in recent revisions it is still flawed at the core in its promotion of social justice throughout it claims that each component of classroom instruction is based on research and supported by practice but lets examine that when it says that it is based on research does this refer to research produced by education schools which are broadly considered to be the intellectual dregs of academia why should this research be trusted last year i got to talk with a student going for his educational doctorate who eventually decided to leave the program he said that his advisor had a longstanding theory that she had worked so long on that any research that went against her theory was no different than going against her personally so that the only acceptable research was that which further supported her theory in other words dont expect to get your degree if your findings contradict my dogma is that the sort of research were talking about how about the second part supported by practice what practice are these components supported by by practice do you mean that these components are already used in schools are these the same schools that keep getting worse and worse every year if 1 social justice has become increasingly a part of education based on research and 2 students increasingly cant do math why exactly should we listen to that research if students were doing better in math before social justice had been shoehorned into every nook and cranny of math education why would we double down on the idea research is only useful if it is falsifiable and if researchers and practitioners are honest with themselves about whether something is working you are not being honest with yourselves the best way to make these students to feel good about themselves is to give them general transferrable skills not to try and tap into their emotions stop trying to teach outside of your area of expertise many k12 teachers are barely competent to teach math but at least they have some training in that they have no training in social work stop trying to shove politics into our schools teach students how to think in a disciplined organized manner and theyll have the tools to come to their own conclusions we dont give you our children in order to indoctrinate them into whatever weak ideologies your handful of years in our universities weakest programs indoctrinated you with  
-1	please reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf the guidance given in the cmf about requires removing procedural fluency memorization and the sequential teaching of mathematics the cmf guidance is to replace this basic approach with instructions that is called open tasks engaging tasks and authentic experiences while these ideas may sound like something that would be helpful they are in fact only ideas and their effectiveness was never proven accordingly before experimenting with our childrens education on statewide bases please insist on extensive multiyear testing these ideas focus on getting lagging students to catch up to their peers by providing math tutoring but for now please reject the cmf as offered  
-1	dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf to have a stem workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in math to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be compete on the world stage holding back able students who have mastered their classlevel math and possibly beyond is damaging to their future and their selfesteem if any student is not performing at the class level  then you need to provide assistance and tutoring to those students thats the right approach and not punishing those succeeding in math and who are aiming to get into college stem programs and careers  
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors not only does it hurt stem majors but any child that excels in math will dislike it when they are bored   
-1	dear california state board of education please reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting the proposed big ideas in the cmf do not promote the proficiency in math and will only hurt our students especially those coming from the communities of color the proposed ideas are not coming from the math professionals or professors these ideas are timetested or proven methods to increase math proficiency do not allow political activists experiment on our kids instead provide the resources and staff to tutor students who are lagging in their math skills thats what will make them successful in math

-1	i strongly oppose this mathematics framework for california public schools  
1	dear members of the state board of education i am writing to express my strong support for the adoption of the new california mathematics framework particularly with regards to its impact on elementary students and equity i was part of the california mathematics cfcc and am proud of the work that we created as a team as we kept equity at the front of center of our work i sought to become part of the cfcc to provide clarity in the framework guided by the principles of equity to create better mathematical structures and outcomes for our students as an elementary math coach i have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by teachers in changing the math experience of students in their classrooms the proposed changes provide comprehensive solutions to address these challenges and empower educators to create an equitable and meaningful learning environment for all students chapter 1 lays a solid foundation by emphasizing the importance of mathematical coherence and the sequential development of mathematical concepts this chapter provides clarity and guidance to teachers enabling them to align their instruction with the progression of mathematical ideas as a math coach this framework will serve as a valuable resource for me in supporting teachers as they navigate the intricacies of building a coherent and robust mathematics curriculum chapter 2 focuses on mathematical practices which are essential for developing students mathematical reasoning and problemsolving abilities by explicitly highlighting these practices the new framework provides teachers with a framework for fostering critical thinking communication and collaboration skills among their students as a math coach i can utilize the framework to help teachers incorporate these practices into their instruction thereby empowering students to become confident mathematical thinkers chapter 3 addresses the critical need for differentiated instruction to cater to the diverse needs of students it provides strategies and resources to help teachers meet students where they are and support their individual growth the framework acknowledges that students come from varied backgrounds and possess differing levels of prior knowledge as a math coach this chapter equips me with practical tools to guide teachers in creating inclusive and equitable classrooms where every student can access highquality math instruction chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching in mathematics education it recognizes that students cultural backgrounds and experiences play a crucial role in their mathematical understanding by incorporating culturally relevant examples and contexts teachers can foster student engagement and deepen their mathematical understanding the framework equips me as a math coach to support teachers in creating culturally responsive classrooms that celebrate diversity and promote a positive math identity for all students chapter 5 focuses on assessment practices that are aligned with the principles of equity and studentcentered learning it emphasizes the use of formative assessment strategies to inform instructional decisions and provide timely feedback to students this chapter enables teachers to make datadriven instructional choices ensuring that all students receive the necessary support and intervention as a math coach i can help teachers implement effective assessment practices that promote equitable learning opportunities for all students chapter 6 as previously mentioned promotes a balanced approach to teaching mathematics by integrating procedural fluency and conceptual understanding this chapter equips teachers with the tools to develop students mathematical proficiency while fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts that centers on big ideas as a math coach i can help teachers navigate this balance and provide guidance on instructional strategies that promote both procedural skills and conceptual understanding chapters 9 10 and 12 address the critical areas of technology integration family engagement and professional learning respectively these chapters recognize the importance of leveraging technology involving families in the mathematics learning process and providing ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers as a math coach i can utilize the framework to support teachers in effectively integrating technology fostering family partnerships and accessing relevant professional learning opportunities finally chapter 13 is crucial as it provides guidance for curriculum publishers to create better instructional materials that center on big ideas use tasks worthy of student engagement and embed exercises in a larger context of investigation the materials provided currently that reflect the 2013 framework require teachers to completely rearrange and piece components together to create a program that somewhat resembles the direction that we should be going in mathematics education these key changes in the materials that will result from the new proposed framework will make the job of teachers so much easier in conclusion the new california math framework addresses the pressing needs of elementary students and promotes equity in mathematics education its comprehensive approach coupled with specific guidance provides me as a math coach with a valuable tool to support teachers in transforming the math experience of their students the frameworks ability to answer questions that were previously unanswered by the previous framework will undoubtedly lead to improved student outcomes and a more equitable mathematics education system thank you for your attention to this matter and i encourage the state board of education to adopt the new california math framework for the benefit of all students across the state sincerely stephanie holloway elementary math coach california mathematics cfcc  
-1	the cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability students are grouped together see chapter nine or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableñas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived ability so that students soon understand who is the high kid and who is the low
-1	please do not adopt the draft framework this experiment failed in sfusd and we cant allow that experiment to further harm californias students please see attached comments  
-1	i oppose the proposed cmf framework lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors please see attached for detailed comments  
-1	please focus on mastering math essentials with methods that deliver results not social justice  
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors  
-1	i oppose the 2023 framework as currently drafted math content standards are being replaced by big ideas not written by mathematicians please see the attached letter for specific detail  
-1	i agree with brian conrad professor of mathematics at stanford with his criticisms of the cmf if you want to get it right you should have mathematicians who teach university level mathematics writing the next revision i am further troubled that boaler appears to have a conflict of interest in recommending measures that lack evidence and promote her own books and curricula please do not adopt the cmf as it stands dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting in the cmf the adopted california common core content standards are being replaced with big ideas aligned to 4 content connections which were not vetted shared with the ca public nor written by people with advanced math degrees the there is no evidence the big ideas will prepare our students for success in mathematics the sbe needs to require that a california math framework focus on the math content standards adopted by the state of california the proposed cmf will fail students especially struggling students as it shifts away from standardsbased instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards illdefined and vague big ideas which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered a california mathematics framework has the following goal this framework serves as a guide to implementing the california common core state standards for mathematics ca ccssm or the standards adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013 ch 1 line 37 yet only 63 of the cmf discusses or even lists specific ca math content standards 1072 lines out of 17088 lines the cmf has clearly failed to do its job in direct contrast to the job of a ca math framework the proposed cmf i ask you to reject recommends teaching big ideas as the content see evidence below who decided the big ideas should replace the content standards which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold phds in mathematics and which were vetted and voted on in california with public knowledge and input according to the cmf three individuals determined the big ideas for california and the cmf in chapter 3 line 244 and again in chapter 3 line 1468 we read three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 and three big ideas boaler munson and williams 2018 related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following who are boaler munson and williams who apparently have the authority to determine what students in california will learn in math well of these three only 1 holds a degree in mathematics cathy williams has a bachelors in applied mathematics none of the three hold a master in mathematics and none of the three hold a phd in mathematics sbe you must reject a framework where big ideas created by nonmathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands if not california will fail to produce a stem workforce the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for stem careers additionally the cmf tells us these big ideas chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree are in fact just one interpretation of big ideas it should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics and those presented in these figures are one variation providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas ch 7 line 952 if this is the case and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards why doesnt the sbe put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in california why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students fate or allowing grade level teams who typically involve teachers without math degrees to decide what big ideas their students will learn this will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation furthermore in reading the cmf it is noted that the big ideas originated during distance learning so a focused set of big ideas indicated as big ideas was created as part of the california digital learning integration and standards guidance initiative cde 2021 these grade level big ideas organized by content connections and inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards are presented in the gradebanded chapters 6 7 and 8 ch 13 line 545 note the use of the phrase inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards why not all content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers evidence that the cmf wants to replace math content standards with their big ideas _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 6 line 228 _ the foundational mathematics contentñthat is the big ideas ch 6 line 942 _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 7 line 165 _ teachers should be teaching from big ideas not individual standards ch 10 line 177 _ educators of preservice teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authenticcontext bigideabased instruction described in this framework ch 10 line 247 so the big ideas proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past this replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design publishers teacher preparation programs and grading as well _ this framework
-1	please see my attached letter 
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors  
-1	we must keep accelerated math options to all students we must also prepare students for uc math requirements and retain tried and true math curriculum common core practices has failed our students and needs to be reigned in  
-1	i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting if the cmf vision is implemented our black and brown students will suffer the most it is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life and yet black or african american and brown latino or hispanic students in california are failing math at historic rates black or african american students are down to 16 proficient or advanced on caaspp in 202122 from their high of 21 in 2019 and latino or hispanic students are down to 21 proficient or advanced in 202122 from their high of 28 in 2019 ch 2 line 54 the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to make progress in math furthermore it is disheartening to have california consider a framework that holds back students who are talented in mathematics and are ready to take calculus in high school it is inconceivable to imagine a similar framework proposed for young students who are talented in soccer that will never happen because young students who are talented in soccer need to join teams that can further their talent same thing applies to mathematics why is california proposing a framework that will hurt our most talented mathematicians thank you for your consideration erika dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses like algebra being an

revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses

then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced english or history this is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics students recognize often as early as kindergarten that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others do not approve a california math framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to accelerate what does nonacceleration look like _ since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11 the cmf describes what grade 10 classes should look like we read when differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students the curriculum remains similar and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus ch 8 line 467 so advanced students 13 years ahead of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below proficient in grade 8 who is the teacher really going to teach if the teacher chooses the middle which is common the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into stem fields and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind there is one vignette in the cmf

mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the july 1213 2023 meeting california students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the caaspp down to 3338 proficient or advanced in 202122 down from about 40 proficient or advanced in 201819 cmf chp 2 line 46 on the national assessment naep california students have also declined with only 30 of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 down from 34 in 2019 link and only 23 of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 down from 29 in 2019 link so what are californias plans to remedy this massive problem while there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses this proposed cmf is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math a simple search of language used in the cmf reveals the primary focus of this math framework is not on learning math content standards but rather on helping kids feel good about math the word identity in reference to building up students math identities to feel positive about the subject appears 25 times the word belonging in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community appears 18 times contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math proficiency is mentioned only 11 times no reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content not as the primary goal of a math teacher following are specific examples of the overemphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency _ this framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community ch 2 line 192 _ both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers ch 2 line 462 _ this concept is about building positive mathematical identities beginning at the prekindergarten level ch 2 line 467 _ teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students backgrounds histories and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging ch 2 line 499 _ teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences ch 2 line 514 1 _ they strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community ch 2 line 792 _ a classroom that welcomes students unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics ch 2 line 871 _ the aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning to which they can contribute and belong ch 2 line 988 _ data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives ch 5 line 123 _ educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content ch 5 line 1400 _ important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social emotional and academic development include the following _ convey mindset and belonging messages ch 5 line 1409 _ this framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive ch 7 line 68 _ the idea is for teachers to help students experience the wonder joy and beauty of math national council of teachers of mathematics and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners ch 7 line 72 _ when students are engaged in meaningful investigative experiences they can come to view mathematics and their own relationship to mathematics far more positively ch 2 line 164 all stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively but that can not be the primary goal of math instruction as a state for the sake of our future we must focus on increasing math proficiency even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math the cmf advises teachers during groupwork the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group which is referred to as assigning competence ch 12 line 244 what california needs is not assigned competence but actual competence which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed the cmf further explains when teachers perceive that a student has become low status in a group they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made ch 12 line 248 if a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past the cmf continues in this vein writing but grouping by perceived ability can be the first step in a system of tracking if similar ability students are grouped together see chapter nine or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableñas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived ability so that students soon understand who is the high kid and who is the low

and vetted by thousands if not california will fail to produce a stem workforce the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for stem careers additionally the cmf tells us these big ideas chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree are in fact just one interpretation of big ideas it should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics and those presented in these figures are one variation providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas ch 7 line 952 if this is the case and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards why doesnt the sbe put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in california why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students fate or allowing grade level teams who typically involve teachers without math degrees to decide what big ideas their students will learn this will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation furthermore in reading the cmf it is noted that the big ideas originated during distance learning so a focused set of big ideas indicated as big ideas was created as part of the california digital learning integration and standards guidance initiative cde 2021 these grade level big ideas organized by content connections and inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards are presented in the gradebanded chapters 6 7 and 8 ch 13 line 545 note the use of the phrase inclusive of multiple ca ccssm content standards why not all content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers evidence that the cmf wants to replace math content standards with their big ideas _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 6 line 228 _ the foundational mathematics contentñthat is the big ideas ch 6 line 942 _ in this framework the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade ch 7 line 165 _ teachers should be teaching from big ideas not individual standards ch 10 line 177 _ educators of preservice teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authenticcontext bigideabased instruction described in this framework ch 10 line 247 so the big ideas proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past this replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design publishers teacher preparation programs and grading as well _ this framework reflects a revised approach advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas ch 1 line 405 _ to help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep active learning of mathematics for all students this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics

-1	due to late release i dont have time to go detail by detail by just reading chapter names and some of framework its obvious that yet again you are setting up the kids of ca to fail at math there is no equity in math ditto inclusive or diversity common core was bad enough in making our kids deficient and this will compound memorization of math facts is the key why dont you emulate the framework of countries or areas in u s that have good math scores this is truly appalling and should not be adopted   
-1	lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm stem majors please see attached dear california state board of education i am writing to ask you to reject the mathematics framework revised draft cmf proposed for the jul 1213 2023 meeting to have a stem science technology engineering and mathematics workforce in the united states we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses such as calculus in high school so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college stem programs and careers the cmf provides at best unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the k12 public school system and at worst denies options for students to accelerate and get to calculus by 12th grade if adopted and implemented the cmf will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system leaving their mathematically advanced but socioeconomically disadvantaged peers stuck in classrooms with students who are often 35 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through stem the first field review of the proposed california math framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11 there was no mention of courses like algebra being an option in grade 8 and in fact studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments thankfully the sbe did not pass that version nor the second version of the cmf and this current third version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade algebra could be an option while progress has been made i ask you to again reject this cmf and require that clear pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations as the current cmf is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students the cmf clearly wants all students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ the cmf describes heterogeneously grouped classrooms from grade school through high school ch 1 line 208 _ the cmf notes possible pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade ch 8 line 702 and ch 8 line 1295 note that chapter 10 line 809 reads the framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight it is obvious that there are not clear recommendations within the cmf about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8 apparently some folks working on the cmf such as was evidenced in the first field review still want no acceleration before grade 11 but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9 this confusing unclear and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a cmf that the sbe adopts 1 _ as evidence for why the us should not allow acceleration before grade 11 the cmf states another review of international evidence about tracking found that while most organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly woessmann 2009 ch 9 line 148 first it is interesting to note that other countries who are far outperforming the us in math allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10 and yet the cmf is recommending waiting until grade 11 what is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration woessmann 2009 discusses students being tracked into different schools not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school there are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a lower school than there are with the current policy in california where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced english or history this is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics students recognize often as early as kindergarten that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others do not approve a california math framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to accelerate what does nonacceleration look like _ since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11 the cmf describes what grade 10 classes should look like we read when differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students the curriculum remains similar and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus ch 8 line 467 so advanced students 13 years ahead of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below proficient in grade 8 who is the teacher really going to teach if the teacher chooses the middle which is common the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into stem fields and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind there is one vignette in the cmf that explains how to support
-1	as a product of californias public school system having access to coursework that challenged me energized me and inspired me into my fullest capabilities was critical for shaping my growth please allow the opportunity for 1 specifically eighth graders to have the opportunity to take algebra if they are ready and desire it 2 more generally to support both students who need extra support and enable students seeking academic challenge to do so  
-1	we should look at states such as massachusetts utah and idaho that have the highest naep scores in math for guidance rather than trying to reinvent the wheel equity and inclusion is important but it should be approached from a lense of social studies and civics rather than hard sciences a mathematics framework should be centered on physical laws rather than social constructs there is room for both in the california school curriculum  
1	the attached letter letter is signed by six of californias education and advocacy organizations who have been collaborating over the past two years to ensure that educators have access to highquality instructional materials that can meet the needs of our highestneed students and close persistent opportunity gaps in this letter we request that the state board of education add language in chapter 13 that ensures educators have access to math instructional materials that are aligned to the english language development eld standards as well as the mathematics content standards  dear members of the state board of education thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools mathematics framework this letter is signed by several of californias educational advocacy and research organizations who have been working together for over two years to ensure that the framework includes principles of equity and strategies to meet the needs of californias diverse student population we believe that the updated framework is assetbased and if implemented properly can help to close opportunity gaps in math instruction we are also pleased to see the focus on equity in pedagogical approaches to teaching math still included from the previous version therefore we write in support of approving the 2023 mathematics framework with a modification to chapter 13 that would ensure that instructional materials are aligned to english language development eld standards we thank the writers staff and members of the instructional quality commission and state board of education for incorporating many of the comments members of this coalition have provided over the past two years the updated framework offers a strong vision for math instruction that is focused on deeper learning and on ensuring there is clear support and equitable access to rigorous coursework for all students in particular we appreciate the following areas the framework emphasizes _ culturally relevant and assetbased the framework offers strategies and vignettes that can make math culturally relevant to students of color and multilingual students these include strategies for drawing on students experiences elevating the assets of linguistically diverse students and families and incorporating families in math learning the vignettes also highlight the diversity of students and offer examples of how educators can meet the needs of students with diverse learning needs _ supporting english learners the framework offers guidance on supporting english learners and leveraging the language assets of students we support references to the english language artseld framework eld standards strategies and scaffolds to support english learners els and assessment considerations however there is still an area of opportunity to add language to chapter 13 category 1 mathematics contentalignment with the standards lines 251275 that would make alignment to eld standards a key feature for instructional materials please see letter submitted on june 6 that discusses this recommendation in more detail understanding that a framework serves as guidance to the field we also emphasize the following areas of focus moving forward that would ensure the promise within the framework is achieved _ opportunity to provide high quality instructional materials leas still need additional guidance and support for ensuring they adopt high quality instructional materials therefore we hope that guidance from the framework can be elaborated on and additional support provided to support leas in their adoption process it is our hope that within the state adoption process the selected reviewers come with various areas of expertise in meeting the needs of our highestneed students including english learners students with disabilities and students of color similar guidance about the areas of expertise that leas should include in their review processes should also be provided to the field tools and resources that can help meet the needs of highneed students should also be incorporated within the state and lea adoption processes for example there are rubrics and tools available that should be incorporated such as criteria for review of instructional materials success in addressing mll linguistic and instructional needs which was recently published by the california curriculum collaborative _ support for implementation while the framework remains long it does include many evidencebased instructional practices that can benefit leas schools and educators therefore we hope that the state provides additional resources and supports to ensure the rich guidance in the framework reaches the field and multiple audiences including lea leaders educators and families these supports can include professional learning opportunities tools and resources county offices of education must also play an important role in providing regional support and guidance to ensure equitable implementation key areas to consider are 1 professional learning related to highleverage instructional strategies 2 support for districts in reviewing and updating policies around enrollment in rigorous math coursework and 3 systems that provide equitable access for all students without support from the state and county offices the promise included within the text of the framework cannot be achieved thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on the draft 2023 mathematics framework as always we are happy to provide additional details or answer any questions sincerely 
-1	i am a parent of 3 children in the san francisco unified school district we have experienced directly how harmful the districts math policies are our children need rigorous math education  this is the only path to equity and to equip all students to succeed in the future the current draft of the framework dumbs down math education as one example this statement is laughable attaining fluency with multiplication and division within 100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students work this is a pitifully low expectation many many students are eager for challenges in math and we are moving backwards we need algebra in middle school strong geometry trig precalc and calculus in high school statistics is wonderful but is not a substitution for calculus which students need in order to be competitive in colleges i urge you to reject this framework that rests in part on flawed data from the sfusd  data that has been demonstrated to be inaccurate please revise the framework to set challenging goals and support students in reaching those goals  
-1	my wife and i deeply appreciate the time and effort you and staff put into the education of our future generations but proposed math teaching methodologies are diametrically opposed to the real world where what you want is the right answer  quickly making answers in sentences is simply making long responses kindergartengrade two example problem 3 and is not real world where 36 plus 25 has 25 on top of 36 and you add 5611 write 1 and carry one over to the 32 column and 32 5  the 1 carried over  61 thats real world  the one these kids will find in their employers standard operating practices manual not some circles equaling 10s so parents who want their kids to learn math will adopt the methods of china and states who exceed in testing  call it repetitive learning not what you will propose for our classrooms but the ray of sunshine will be the teacher who learned math in a 4 room farm community schoolhouse  repetitively  and will repeat that method in addition to what you now want thank you for this time and good luck  
0	dear california state board of education i wanted to draw your attention to a technical error in the third edition of the mathematics framework that should be changed before vote and publication chapter 9 structuring school experiences for equity and engagement includes a section on personalized learning beginning on page 13 within this section which we are strongly supportive of there is an example of our innovative learning model which begins on page 15 starting with line 376 and continuing to line 378 it reads 376 a study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate on average on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group margolis 2019 however this study margolis 2019 of our teach to one model has been incorrectly attributed in to another example of a teacherdeveloped approach from modern classroom which starts on line 372 372 in one successful teacherdeveloped approach students engage in blended selfpaced masterybased learning with teachermade videos supplementing inclass problemsolving individually and in collaborative groups with continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and competence modern classroom 2021 a study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate on average on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group margolis 2019 it should instead read as it did in draft two  372 in one successful teacherdeveloped approach students engage in blended selfpaced masterybased learning with teachermade videos supplementing inclass problemsolving individually and in collaborative groups with continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and competence modern classroom 2021 a similar model developed by a middle school teacher and now taught in many schools uses diagnostic assessments to create a tailored set of assignments for each student that the teacher can use in technologyinfused mix of direct instruction collaborative work with peers and individualized learning a study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate on average on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group margolis 2019 i appreciate this opportunity to comment on the third draft of the mathematics framework and bring this technical error to your attention  
-1	this is insane math is not a subjective subject math by definition only has one correct answer that has nothing to do with equity or environmental justice or any of this other gobbledygook leftist nonsense you are pushing on the kids california public education has gone from the top 10 to the bottom 10 in the us since the left agenda has been implemented how does that serve our kids how are they supposed to compete in the world you need to scrap this nonsense and get back to the basics  
-1	this framework promotes a curriculum boaler created and benefits from directly and for no other reason should be dismissed but if you need another reason it is also completely unproven and without peer reviews please dont adopt this for our kids when there are much better and more tested frameworks available  
-1	my recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful ð like those in massachusetts utah idaho and china for starters instead our government has taken a nonpolitical subject ð math ð heavily politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for equity ð whatever that means   
1	we at san bernardino county superintendent of schools write this letter in support of the 2023 mathematics framework we feel that this framework is necessary to support mathematical achievement for all of our students we agree with the authors compelling argument that we cannot afford any inaction or keep the status quo of mathematics teaching and learning the mission of san bernardino county superintendent of schools is to transform lives through education this is in alignment with the goal of the framework to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all california students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the world we are appreciative of the time and effort that was taken by the writers to take the call to action along with the current requirements of the board of education to create a document that views equity so important in this day and age we appreciate the time and resources in producing a document that is consistent in language organization and formatting we look forward to using this document as a support for educators a place to calibrate and deepen our understanding of the teaching and learning of mathematics for the students of california thank you melanie janzen math curriculum coordinator priscilla rice math curriculum coordinator andrea barron math curriculum specialist san bernardino county superintendent of schools  
-1	please oppose every student deserves the ability to excel at math math is crucial to success in a huge number of well paid and engaging jobs if this bill passes moderate and high achieving public school students will be 1 to 2 years behind their private school peers my wife is a public school teacher and we cannot afford private school but our kids work hard both love math and they should not be disadvantaged san franciscos math results are atrocious we live there san francisco should be an example of what not to do parents are already revolting and working to bring back algebra 1 please dont make the same mistake as san francisco support the ability of all california children not just the rich ones to get a high quality math education thank you  
-1	this measure designed to promote diversity will in fact have the opposite effect the very students who will be harmed by this measure and there are large numbers of them are those minority students who have the ability to do algebra in the 8th grade but are told it is too difficult for them what kind of a message is that it is promoting a race to the bottom instead of helping students to excel this has not worked in san francisco  the results are dismal  so now you want to enact it state wide is that the role of government  to promote a failing policy that harms our students as if covid wasnt bad enough in the name of diversity that is shameful   
1	to whom it may concern i am writing to share my staunch support for the approval of the revised california mathematics framework having been a principal for the past seven years i can say without hesitation that all of the resources vignettes and recommended instructional practices have been hugely helpful in supporting new and veteran teachers to provide engaging and meaningful math instruction for their students i especially appreciate chapter 2 which highlights 5 components of equitable and engaging teaching i incorporated much of what was in this chapter into a professional learning series aimed at energizing and motivating teachers to plan their instruction around these practices the throughline of focusing on equity in this framework is just what we need in our schools right now please approve this framework sincerely sara green  
-1	absolutely rubbish absolutely a step in the wrong direction you are about to assure that the rest of the world flies further ahead of this state while relegating math to a series of lessons to identify the ways the rest of the world flies ahead of this state i dont want to be surrounded by people who identify as victims i want to be surrounded by people who are properly educated   
-1	please stop with this nonsense math is supposed to be objective factual already im seeing bizarre ways of doing math being brought home by my first grader but this new framework is a nightmare i agree with julie hamill that we should adopt a different framework entirely and scrap this one we all know what is intended by the word equity and this is a gross misuse of power by our elected officials in an attempt to force indoctrination of our children can we go back to the math curriculums of 40 years ago please math is logical math makes sense math is not political  
-1	what on earth is going on there is no mass anymore its all politicized and based on equity nonesense california public schools have some of the lowest literacy rates in the nation and you are changing the math to basically remove math and make a political you are destroying a generation of children stop this insanity and stick to academics i will pull my kids out of this nightmare you are causing   
0	re ca math framework changes 1 ca should be using 2023 reality and awareness and not guidelines emerging from 2019 everything has changed since 2019 ca needs to go back to the drawing board asap the guidelines are based on statutory requirements feedback from focus group meetings in august of 2019 student focus groups in september and october 2019 information provided by the instructional quality commission and the state board of education and public comment 2 although this is a laudable goal it has nothing to do with teaching math the cfcc shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the gradelevel chapters to support universal access and ensure access equity and inclusion for all students 3 naep math scores have plunged in ca ca fails to include discussion of bringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the naep proves 4 the insertion of equity discussion does not belong in math class but rather in social sciences 5 there is no provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math class as a discussion class on equity 6 udl contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or math competency 7 naep scores lowest in a decade where is the math proficiency component in the math framework 8 more significantly perhaps the amount of 13yearolds deemed proficient or better in math went from 34 percent in 2019 to just 26 percent today 9 in math scores went from terrible to worse 41 percent proficient in 2019 to just 36 percent proficient in 2022 10 the naep reading proficiency was also stunningly low 37 percent in 2019 down from 40 percent in 1998 11 students will continue to fail if ca refuses to address actual proficiency in math and reading ca fails to provide the plan for students who are failing and provide for those students who are able to proficient and able to take advanced classes provided over the past two years the updated framework offers a strong vision for math 
-1	i am writing to express my concerns with the revised draft v3 of the ca mathematics framework i am also a california resident and a parent that cares deeply about education i am a computer scientist i teach college courses in data science and computer science and i have a solid understanding of the foundations needed for success in collegelevel stem i am also an experienced researcher and understand how to use data evidence and citations i am very concerned with this draft the revised version corrected some of the issues in v2 in particular the mic pathway that was ill defined and should have never been there was removed but many glaring issues remain and few new ones were added most importantly the document is very far from being useful and seems ideologydriven rather than evidence and researchbased it does not follow basic standards of scholarship the stakeholders students parents school districts colleges industry expect and deserve a guidance document that is done professionally that includes a careful synthesis of the education literature and a review of best practices that work the draft is a mockery of scholarship statements are being written with citations that frequently do not support the statements other citations are not to scholarly documents but to opinion pieces that make nonverifiable and sometimes egregious claims at other occasions there is solid research that supports the opposite recommendation that is just being completely ignored this is unacceptable another issue is the conflictridden uc areac loophole where courses that have very little math content were approved as advanced math courses that validate algebra 2 the cmf earlier drafts were part of a mass campaign that deceived ca students and families with regard to the preparation needed for collegelevel stem the current v3 draft retracted some of this hype removed the falselyrepresented mic pathway but some of the hype remains it is rather astonishing and unacceptable that the v3 draft still alludes to the faulty approval of these courses a careless mistake at best as a way to promote false ideas the v3 draft made cosmetic and wording changes and still ignored many of the issues that were previously pointed out painstakingly by brian conrad and others at this point it seems clear that the issues can not be simply fixed by addressing specific comments careful review and addressing in a sincere way all comments by professor brian conrad mike lawler and tom loveless will only get us part of the way to create a helpful document a new writing team needs to write the document from scratch finally the time given to the public to review the 1000 pages draft with so little warning is insufficient especially for a document that is so far from being acceptable i hope you will take responsibility for our students and all stakeholders and reject the current draft  
-1	math is not and cannot be based in equity principles instead of reinventing the curriculum cde should look to other states who have high math assessment scores and look at the curricula and methodologies without a good foundation in math skills california students loose the opportunity to later excel in math based professions accounting finance engineering medicine etc california students deserve better

0	the csu has affirmed its support of using the caccssm content standards for algebra 1 geometry and algebra 2 or integrated math 13 in a recent resolution   changing the framework should be done in a way that is easily and transparently compatible with the current caccssm content standard or it should be done in coordination with a revision of those standards the 2022 and 2023 cmf drafts do neither and thus we have a much improved but still controversial 900 page document that creates an awkward and cumbersome framework consisting of drivers for investigation content connections the caccssm mathematical practice and big ideas however the interaction of the big ideas and the other components dis ccs mps is unclear moreover the big ideas seem to replace the caccssm at least on the student facing side which may be an okay idea if on the teacher side the connections are clear unfortunately the 900 pages of the framework fail to make those connections in the crucial and controversial area of algebra 2 and integrate 3 this sows distrust and concern by comparison one could look at illustrative mathematics which works within the structures of the common core while also building in progressions across grade levels contextualization with an eye to broaden engagement and attention to professional development the committee would do well to read the article summarizing a forum that the ams committee on education hosted in june last year where these issues were discussed cordially and professionally   the best course of action would be to restart the framework process and do it in conjunction with a review of the icas revision of   and a revision of the caccssm

are 37 years below grade level which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77 of 11th graders were below proficient on the sbac in 202122 link with over 70 of students below proficient in grade 8 who is the teacher really going to teach if the teacher chooses the middle which is common the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into stem fields and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind there is one vignette in the cmf that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully ch 9 beginning line 327 but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at
1	the proposed framework will support all students in california to have access to more enriching engaging and applicable mathematics education  
-1	teach math the traditional way the way it used to be taught the way the asian community learns math why not just use an idea that is proven to workéobviously they are a community that excels in math lets remove the bigotry of low expectations against other cultures and people  
0	in the faq section under the topic of access to calculus in high school i know of a school district that limits 8thgrade enrollment to algebra a prerequisite to calculus out of 800 8thgrade students only 120 spaces were provided for algebra i recommend that the state board of education develop requirements to encourage increased access to algebra chapter 9 structuring school experiences for equity and engagement  slow vs speed was discussed the discussion did not address the situations when slow is necessary and fast are required it is similar to riding a bicycle we start out slow and through practice we are able to ride fast without even thinking about the riding process students can learn to be fast in basic math when facing a complex problem slow is definitely the best approach the discussion in chapter 9 does not address the need for students to become fast for basic math such as multiplication i volunteered as a tutor in a continuation program the students needed calculators to figure out what is 8x7 i gave them a multiplication table to practice on they have to learn to ride without training wheels calculators another example of fast vs slow if i am asked what is d x2 dy i should be able to give the answer instantly and not have to take the slow approach general questions  the us is behind on math compared to the rest of the world and ca is below us average that is a rather sad state of affairs will the cde monitor the results from this new math framework on a regular basis and publish the results and will the cde require local school districts to do likewise without the publication of results this exercise of proposing a math framework is rather meaningless and how will the cde respond if the framework produces negative results will the cde change the framework quickly  
-1	the framework does nothing to close the disparities in math achievement it is vague and does nothing to lift everyone up in math achievement its more of drag everyone down to the lowest achievement approach scrap and redo please  
-1	if i were in charge of creating a new math framework i would look to the states and countries that are excelling in math massachusetts utah and idaho have the highest naep scores in math first generation chinese immigrants explained to me the drilling and repetition they learned in school and wonder why we cannot implement the same here ð because it works the framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords light on actual math it reads like an instructional manual on social justice ð not how to teach math the main focus is equity ð for which there are no measurable objective benchmarks in fact i did not find anything in the framework regarding how to measure success if anyone else found that part please tell me the framework defines equity as equity equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness drawing from gutierrez 2012 equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education 1 access to tangible resources 2 participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them 3 student identity development in mathematics and 4 attention to relations of power do we really need to be focused on student identity development in math or attention to relations of power can we not just teach everyone math this is objectively insane to me from the overview the goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all california students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldñin their careers in college and in civic life from chapter 1 reflecting the states commitment to equity every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all equity is such

on this math framework and i dont think anything can be done to change course we have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of cde it is not surprising that they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas my recommendation would be to completely scrap this entire framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven

1	please adopt the new math framework it is sad that the sticking point seems to be access for all this does not diminish rigor as some claim if california is to keep its place as an economic world leader it must keep up with countries and us states that let math education pump graduates into the workforce not filter them out our previous system only has the benefit of keeping established math professors in their comfort zones unchallenged in their superiority we can do better and the proposed framework is a tool to do just that   
-1	our state is falling behind in math we need to follow peer reviewed successful math curriculum pathways not ones that discourage or disallow meeting kids at the level of math they are at as this plan does as a california constituent mother of public elementary school kids and attorney i write to strongly request you do not adopt this framework  
-1	this failed in sf and will fail our schools 
-1	in ch 1 of the cmf lines 610619 it is stated problems tasks which students do not already have the tools to solve precede teaching of the focal mathematics necessitated by the problem that is the major point of a problem is to raise questions that can be answered and encourage students to use their intuition to address the questions before learning new mathematical ideas i strongly oppose the recommendation of what is otherwise known as productive struggle first in the website for the common core math standards it states that the standards do not require specific pedagogies but cmf is certainly doing that secondly current research does not support such strategy specifically see   in this study ashman et al concludes that for learning where element interactivity is high explicit instruction should precede problemsolving if i were in charge of creating a new math framework i would look to the states and countries that are excelling in math massachusetts utah and idaho have the highest naep scores in math first generation chinese immigrants explained to me the drilling and repetition they learned in school and wonder why we cannot implement the same here ð because it works the framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords light on actual math it reads like an instructional manual on social justice ð not how to teach math the main focus is equity ð for which there are no measurable objective benchmarks in fact i did not find anything in the framework regarding how to measure success if anyone else found that part please tell me the framework defines equity as equity equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness drawing from gutierrez 2012 equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education 1 access to tangible resources 2 participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them 3 student identity development in mathematics and 4 attention to relations of power do we really need to be focused on student identity development in math or attention to relations of power can we not just teach everyone math this is objectively insane to me from the overview the goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all california students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldñin their careers in college and in civic life from chapter 1 reflecting the states commitment to equity every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2 9 and 10 its also focused on environmental literacy ð which has nothing to do with learning math in summary the horse is out of the barn on this math framework and i dont think anything can be done to change course we have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of cde it is not surprising that they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas my recommendation would be to completely scrap this entire framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful ð like those in massachusetts utah idaho and china for starters instead our government has taken a nonpolitical subject ð math ð heavily politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for equity ð whatever that means  
-1	i strongly oppose the proposed math framework and find it utterly unacceptable that the general public is being granted a mere 11day window to review and provide feedback on the revised draft this period even includes a federal holiday on a tuesday which further restricts the available time for scrutiny to make matters worse there was no prior notification or updates regarding the schedule of significant events with no modifications made to that page since july of 2022 suddenly a colossal 1006page document materializes on the website in late june this disregard for transparency and public input is especially outrageous considering the multitude of issues identified in the previous draft during the second field review numerous problems were exposed within the initial draft these issues range from misrepresented citations and misconceptions about the requisite math skills for contemporary college degrees in both stem and stemadjacent fields to an inadequately developed data science pathway which clearly has no rightful place in this framework additionally the draft presented flawed opinionbased recommendations concerning highschool pathways acceleration equity technology assessment and placement such a flawed approach is detrimental to the wellbeing and education of our children  
-1	algebra should be taught in 8th grade for those who are ready for it failure to offer it will only harm children and put them further behind in their education stop dumbing down the curriculum   
-1	are we there yet a new framework was adopted in 2013 which replaced californias algebra for all in 8th grade policy a lot of misinformation was disseminated to say that california students were not doing well in algebra 1 by using repeat rates instead of failure a circus shell game if ever there was one students had to pass the algebra 1 cst old star system and receive a c in order to be promoted to geometry the ed code changed in 2016 and the math placement act also was enacted to stop forcing students to repeat classes based on test scores if they had already passed the class it is nonsense to use data pre 2013 as a comparison to post common core however we do have an on going experiment in san francisco based on dr boalers recommendations many which are in this framework and in fact this framework reads like an informercial for youcubed her stanford non profit san francisco did not track previously everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 8th grade in 2014 everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 9th grade there was no improvement in grades what did happen is the underserved communities lost access to higher math precalculus enrollment did not increase sfusd lied about their compression class calling it algebra 2  precalculus but uc ag rejects it as a precalculus class and gives algebra 2 credit this under preparation harms students diversifying stem is extremely important this framework does not accomplish this goal it will increase opportunity gaps as the resourced supplement the sold a story podcast literacy should be required listening because were about to do the same thing in math sfusd stands as a warning beacon to all that pass do not do this it has failed lets not wait 10 years and say ooops this is not a holodeck simulation real peoples lives are at stake we cannot afford to leave bipoc students behind as sfusd has done please reject this and rewrite it with true equity in mind not superficial hallmark card sentiments   
1	please adopt this framework i am a k12 math educator parent of public school grads university math educator and i support this framework   
1	i sent in many criticisms of the last version of the framework as far as i can tell in this short time available most of my comments were addressed other than the length of the document i still think the length will make it daunting for classroom teachers to even consider reading in depth i do hope there will be substantial professional development support for classroom teachers if we hope to have the key ideas in this framework implemented  
-1	as a minority woman of color holding a california license to practice law is simply despicable that a failed policy that affected san francisco kids is now to be implemented state wide didnt you learnt anything from the harvard decision the time for white people to lowered all the standards for poc so their own children are the only ones succeeding is over and if you decide to pass such in your face discriminatory policy because you believe brown and black are less smart you seriously are the problem and you should check your racist views karina velasquez esq   
1	i approve of the math framework 
-1	opposed to the current math plan education is a dicey topic  ca does a great job for the middle of the curve however you must not sacrifice the best students on the alter of the middle  these are our einsteins turings and musks do not disincline 8th graders from algebra it may or may not have worked in sf but thats no call to roll out statewide i personally in another state had done algebra and geometry before 9th grade dont penalize our best an brightest s  
1	as the executive director of cpm educational program a california 501c3 educational nonprofit corporation providing mathematics curriculum and professional development for grades 612 i highly value feedback as a core part of developing researchinformed curriculum i believe in more math for more people so i am delighted to see that the revised framework maintains the crucial commitment to equity and inclusivity which are essential for meeting the diverse needs of california students on behalf of cpm i urge the board to approve the revised 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools kindergarten through grade twelve  
1	this framework is so important for our students we need change around mathematics and giving students the opportunity to learn learn through big ideas have more choice with different pathways and provide opportunities for all students is essential please vote for the changes in the framework for our kids  
-1	the prior drafts of the cmf had serious problems with accurate and appropriate references claims that have been removed from prior drafts include i the repeat rate in san francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to 9th grade fell from 40 to 8 and ii most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math problems with references continue with this draft my recommendation is that all references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either removed or replaced with proper references if they cannot be replaced the items in the cmf that depend on the nonacademic references need to be removed too ill provide two examples of nonacademic references below that should be removed but these are just two examples to make the point clear all of the nonacademic references need to be examined carefully by the california department of education for example the boaler munson and williams reference from youcubed  what is mathematical beauty  is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for books written by the authors as boaler is also an author of the cmf having a reference advertising her books included in the cmf is inappropriate a second example is the boaler and foster paper on youcubed  raising expectations and achievement again this is not academic research the paper has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the cmf as political it is inappropriate to have a reference in the cmf criticizing opposition to the cmf this paper also discusses a study  referred to as study 2 in the paper  that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015 this comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student achievement from a score difference on an algebra ii test one year and an 8th grade math test in the next year this reference to the study in this paper in chapter 9 of the cmf goes even farther to state without reference or explanation that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling the claims about study 2 in chapter 9 of the cmf are an example of important claims in the cmf in this case tracking that are not backed by published academic research again this reference  and all nonacademic research cited in the cmf  needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic research as this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015 there has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores if the only discussion of these exam scores is the post on youcubed this reference and the discussion about tracking supported by it needs to be removed there are millions of students in california whose lives will be affected by the cmf it is the responsibility of the california department of education to ensure that the ideas in the document are supported properly non academic work like blog posts books or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as academic work the inclusion of advertisements and political statements about opposition are obviously not appropriate references nonacademic studies cannot be central to the cmfs proposal either once the references are corrected or the material removed what remains in the cmf can be evaluated properly  
-1	i am a parent of sf public school children the framework you plan to adopt prevents algebra in eight grade which has proven ineffective in sf please do not adopt it statewide  
-1	this framework kills algebra for hard working students that are ready for the challenge it will put them at a disadvantage when competing for college and jobs with young people from other states given the national need for more stem candidates and graduates this policy is a major and moronic step backward please give it the f it deserves  
-1	as a parent of three kids in the public school system in california im writing to express my concern with version 3 of the california math framework specifically im concerned with the promotion of a forprofit curriculum youcubed that lacks robust research evidence and runs counter to the wisdom of many stem teachers and researchers i fear that this move will put california students further behind in math people with privilege myself included may be able to compensate by teaching our kids ourselves or enrolling them in supplemental programs whereas families without those resources are vulnerable to widening disparities in math achievement and fluency as a result of this misguided effort additionally i am concerned about the removal of algebra as an option for 8th graders who are ready for it providing opportunities for stem advancement in public schools is one the greatest gifts we can give our kids please do not shortchange california public school students   
-1	i find it unconscionable that the public would be given only 11 days to review and comment on the revised draft of this framework a period containing a tuesday federal holiday no less there was no advance notice or updates to the schedule of significant events provided no changes made to that page since july of 2022 and a 1006 page document simply appeared on the website in late june this is particularly egregious in light of the multitude of problems found in the prior draft the second field review exposed many issues in that draft including those of misrepresented citations misconceptions about the math skills required for contemporary college degrees both in stem and stemadjacent fields a mathematically anemic data science pathway that had no business being part of this framework in the first place and faulty opinionbased recommendations related to highschool pathways acceleration equity technology assessment and placement these issues are on record in the sfr public comments from brian conrad maya keshavan edith cohen jelani nelson and others in my preliminary reading of this 2023 draft ive found the same statements of opinion many of them reworded to sound slightly less objectionably mistaken and often with no evidence cited whatsoever misrepresented citations still appear even though brian conrad had pointed them out in painstaking detail and the cmf assertions for those that were removed still remain in the revised document chapter 8 illustrates pathways for high school coursework reflecting a common ninth and tenthgrade experience and this experience puts algebra 1 squarely in 9th grade not 8th even though the superintendent of san francisco unified school district has announced that this plan has failed after 10 years of shoddy proficiency performance and families are clamoring to have the district bring back algebra in 8th grade the cited evidence being used to support nearly all of the bold assertions and change guidance in this framework are rarely from appropriate sources and when they are they represent a onesided take from the existing body of evidence i will follow up with another comment covering this issue in more detail you must reject this framework and go back to the drawing board  
-1	a big lie and big failure as proven with evidence in news media recently for san francisco unified school district why would you want to spread this lie to other school districts in california unless you want more states to beat california in education of mathematics  
-1	a big lie and big failure in san francisco unified school district why would you want to spread this lie to other school districts in california  
-1	i am a parent of two current high school students in san francisco i strongly feel that the elimination of an option for algebra for san francisco 8th graders has been a huge mistake and created missed opportunities for so many students with an aptitude for math and a desire to pursue careers in stem my daughters both love math and always excelled in their studies but were not given the opportunity in 8th grade to take algebra they both know they want to pursue a college degree in a stem field and will need to complete calculus in 12th grade in order to be competitive for the programs they are interested in finding a path for them to be able to reach calculus in 12th grade has not been easy my older daughter took algebra online ahead of 9th grade through a paid online course and then had to pass an exam administered by the district in order to take geometry as a 9th grader my younger daughter plans to study and hopefully pass a course in precalculus in the summer between 11th and 12th grade in order to take calculus in 12th grade we need a california math framework that is datadriven researchproven and teachersupported and does not leave our students behind the rest of the nation   
-1	i have 3 children in public school and it would be doing them a major disservice to create a new mathmatics framework that would prevent 8th graders from access to algebra 1 this decision will place california public students behind the students from other states in their mathematic education please allow those who are ready to have access to algebra 1  
-1	it is shameful that our educational leaders are not pushing to advance math skills and to push our children into achieving higher levels of mathematics as a parent of a rising 6th grader and a rising 5th grader i am flabbergasted that the goal is not to try to get more children into algebra in 8th grade we should be aiming higher and raising the bar rather than putting california children at a competitive disadvantage please allow children that are ready to progress to keep growing and work on getting more children into 8th grade algebra not preventing them from achieving more  
-1	it is extremely troubling that the sbe is rushing this egregiously flawed document through under cover of darkness given it impacts millions of children i would like to comment on just a few of the proposed cmfs errors 1 rampant citation misrepresentation many of the documents assertions are quite simply hard to believe they were justified via citations to other papers in essentially all cases the papers were seriously misrepresented in the cmf some even had conclusions opposite to what was said in the cmf the solution is to remove all references to nonacademic research since those papers have no standards and are not good references for a math framework that is going to affect millions of children the next step is to replace all references that are not peer reviewed academic papers with references to actual research cant find any well you have your answer 2 gross conflict of interest cmf authors stand to profit from recommendations made in the document eg selling recommended curriculum this presents a significant conflict of interest probably it is illegal 3 misrepresentation of data science field the authors conflate statistics and data science they are not the same also data science undergraduate degrees require calculus and data science jobs at spotify salesforce amazon dropbox google linkedin etc require degrees in fields such as math economics engineering computer science etc and these require calculus and linear algebra overall the field and its prerequisites are grossly misrepresented worse the cmf writing team has ignored the explicit warnings by sbe member patricia rucker that bias towards data science over other math routes is forbidden 4 activism and jargon vs substance the document contains lengthy passages having little to do with math content and graphics giving no relevant information   
-1	as an educator i am opposed to the framework as it is currently put together i urge the board to read   for example and see how research does not support claims in the framework and i believe that offering algebra in the 8th grade is an essential part of preparing california children for the technological and scientific world into which they will grow up thank you  
-1	im a parent of two sfusd children who are now in high school ive had a front row seat to how this curriculum has been rolled out in sf and it is completely backfiring children of parents of means circumvent the lack of algebra by paying for online coursework children who grasp the subject matter are bored in their classes and ultimately disadvantaged kids are simply left further behind there is no sound evidence that this policy has improved math scores for any child but it has definitely widened the achievement gap this is the very definition of failed policy our kids need more opportunities to be challenged not less   
-1	please allow 8th graders to take algebra and allow students to have advanced coursework without this many advanced students leave the district  which creates more issues with inequality that existed before   
-1	bring back math tracks and therefore algebra 1 into middle schools many kids are not challenged sufficiently starting in late elementary and then middle school they get bored and disengage give those who are ready an opportunity to learn  
-1	im the parent of a sfusd student entering 9th grade it seems wrong that the best way to help my daughter achieve was to pay for her to take online algebra classes to be able to get to calculus in high school as i was able to do there are many  maybe most  kids who could get through algebra in 8th grade i do not think the state should copy the practice of sfusd particularly since the district seems to be walking away from it  
-1	san francisco public schools math failure has caused hundreds families to have to leave the district or utilize expensive workarounds to be able to reach calculus by senior year california should not follow this same failed pattern and lose millions of students in san francisco instead of promoting equity it deepened the divide instead of different pathways within the same schools there is a huge divide with public school student lagging behind private school students in math california needs workers who have the mathematics background to succeed in the tech industries and california students need college and career paths that will sustain them in this high cost of living state allowing for higher level mathematics including 8th grade algebra gives student opportunities to succeed in ca  
-1	we want algebra for 8th grade the current proposal is unacceptable  
-1	dont dumb down our students challenge them give them choices  
-1	i am a mother of two sfusd students and a physicianscientist i strongly support allowing california students to take advanced math at young ages so that they can reach their full potential this includes being able to take ap calculus bc an high school senior which i did allowing advanced students to take 8th grade algebra in public school is fundamental to that goal vote no on these misguided math standards alison rustagi md phd  
-1	please continue to offer 8th grade algebra it benefits many low income underrepresented students please do not make stem education available only to the wealthy will the next generation of silicon valley employees be california natives or be immigrants from countries that emphasize education   
-1	please do not proceed with the proposed changes to californias math curriculum  
-1	the california math framework needs to offer algebra in middle school to every student who is ready for it failing to have this as an integral part of the math framework widens the socioeconomic gaps among our california students and citizens   
-1	the mathematics framework for k12 students should state that math instructions and curriculum used in public school would have no influence or indoctrination from or association with political viewpoints and goals toward social justice and racial equity correlation is not causation just as the super bowl indicator is neither believable nor accurate the correlation between students racial makeup and math performance can not be used to argue that race is a factor in students math or academic performance if we gather enough data we may find a strong positive correlation between math performance and religion or math performance and hair color or math performance and students favorite sport or hobby but it would be unwise for us to try to achieve equity in religion hair color sports or hobby rather students performance is the result of numerous factors including family dynamic family value and attitude about education students personal motivation students academic abilities students time living in the us students study habits and sturdy time parents involvement in students daily learning teaching effectiveness at schools etc every kid is different so we should not strive for equalized outcome some kids will be good in math and some wont just like some will be good in language arts and some wont let those who wish to study advanced materials do so and let others who only wish to learn the basics do as they wish taxpayers of ca should find schools that teach useful and practical math in grades k12 to prepare students for career or higher education and give equal access and learning opportunity to all students at public schools taxpayers should not fund educational framework or curriculum that is tied to social justice racial equity social activism or political viewpointsbias   
-1	i am floored as a parent of two age school children in san francisco that the state of california would consider this abomination of a framework at this point in time post pandemic when we are trying to recoup learning loss one more thing to lower standards and make our kids last how does the state expect to recoup this loss by adding a more complex system of instruction look at the test scores but more importantly listen to teachers and parents trust me when i tell you the struggles of our rising 5th grader not knowing his times tables i directly attribute this to the curriculum trying to do too many things at once  multiple concepts and approaches and hardly any memorization to get it into long term memory im pleading with you all to simplify this its already over engineered and youre going to make it worse right now we go through nightly pain of teaching math facts and concepts instead of the actual practicing problems this overtaxes the young childs brain to the point where when faced with choices they dont know which approach to take please dont do this you are confusing our students loveless states big ideas openended tasks collaborative problem solving lessons on mindset and inquirybased teachingñthese are foundational to the framework the proposed california math framework not only ignores key expectations of the states math standards but it also distorts or redefines them to serve a reform agenda the standards call for students to know from memory basic addition facts by the end of 2nd grade and multiplication facts by the end of 3rd grade but the framework refers to developing fluency with basic facts as a major topic of 4th through 6th grades fluency is redefined to disregard speed instruction on standard algorithms is delayed by interpreting the grades for culminating standards as the grades in which standard algorithms are first encountered californias students will be taught the standard algorithm for division years after the rest of the world  
-1	adopting the new math framework would be terrible we need to support gifted children not bring them down  
-1	im not sure why anyone thinks that setting up cmf to model san francisco is a good idea i live in san francisco ive noticed quite a few kumon businesses have sprung up why do you think that is because parents who have children in san francisco public schools know that in order for their children to succeed and be ready for high school math they need to pay for after school lessons this alone makes equity a joke you will never achieve equity its a ridiculous idea to try and achieve equal opportunity needs to be the focus and item 11 will do just the opposite shame on anyone who thinks lowering standards is a good idea its racist in nature everyone voting on this item should do research on the results that recently came out regarding san franciscos elimination of 8th grade algebra its dismal if this passes everyone who voted in favor will be on the wrong side of history   
-1	eliminating the opportunity for 8th graders in california public schools to take algebra will have devastating consequences for kids who like math my child was a student in sfusd k8 schools and was so bored by the math curriculum that we ended up having to supplement from 28th grades slowing down the curriculum was meant to bring more students along the math path and she put a ton of effort into helping her classmates but studies show this experimental policy has failed the kids it was meant to help the idea that slowing down the curriculum for all kids instead of meeting individual kids where their abilities lie will leave californias public school students at a disadvantage when competing for degrees and jobs that require math skill for high school we decided to leave our district in favor of a private school as did many families who have the resources to opt out as more families experience this slower math curriculum and opt out when they can ca public schools will become a second class education option one that will not prepare students to compete in a job market that increasingly favors degrees in math and science please do not adopt this horrible policy instead put resources into meeting all children where theyre at thank you kelly inouye  
-1	the san francisco usd math experiment has failed and it would be tragic to impose worse curriculum on the rest of the state we need higher standards and a culture of excellence to prepare our kids with the numeracy skills needed to be successful we should base our curriculum on rigorous methods and standards and not the discredited and expensive youcubed material  
-1	it is ridiculous that the state of california is proposing to remove algebra education from 8th grade my san francisco unified school district has this policy in place and it is utterly against the wishes of the parent community all students who are ready should be able to take an algebra class in 8th grade my current 9th grader was forced by this policy to take an extra math course virtually uc scout to place out of algebra clearly she was ready to do the coursework as she passed easily and obtained credit from the district it only cost us 895 we paid out of pocket pity the families who cannot afford that for their children do not allow this to become california policy  
-1	as a stem parent i strongly oppose the current math framework and we should not adopt this for the whole of california we are holding kids back theres no evidence based implementation to contradict this we need 8th grade algebra option now if you want california back the goal is to keep our kids ahead and not hold them back you will lose kids enrolled in public school as well as people moving out of california   
-1	this framework is going to set californian students up for failure it is watering down math education standard while we are facing stiff international competition in stem fields we need to raise the rigor of our middle and high school math curriculum this framework is doing the exact opposite   
-1	i fervently oppose the adoption of version 3 of the california math framework for california public schools as a parent of child who went through the public school system in san francisco sfusd where the curriculum was implemented and failed with miserable results i noticed first hand how my child and other children fell behind in math trailing at least a year in some cases 2 years behind other public schools districts in the country sfusd math policy was one of the major factors sfusd school board were recalled in an unprecedent public election this failed math experiment must not plague other california public schools as saddened as i am to see my child and her peers to have served as guinea pigs in this ill advised endeavor i implore you to reconsider this if you wish to educate california children further to become ready not only for stem careers but also in other fields where analytical and math skills are required   
-1	as a school counselor for the past 18 years and now a parent of middle school students i have seen what failing to provide eighth grade algebra has done to our students in san francisco it has not increased the number of black and brown students who can access higher level math it has done nothing to ensure that theres equity in the math provided for all of our students instead it has created circuitous and stressful alternate pathways for our students who want to excel in mathematics at a higher level they are forced to take algebra during their ninth grade year and compress their geometry algebra 2 or their precalc learning into shortened periods of time so that they can achieve their goal of taking ap calculus during senior year or ap statistics this means that there are mathematics courses that are not given the year long time for a student to truly learn that particular math and it means the student has to undergo an incredibly stressful situation to compact a math course into a short amount of time please do not use san francisco unified as an example of where it works instead use us as an example of what not to do which is eradicate eighth grade algebra it didnt work and it just left families upset and students with inadequate learning opportunities   
-1	the current proposal before the board of education will hold back advanced students without meaningfully helping students who need it weve seen this policy attempted in san francisco and it was a failed experiment as highlighted by numerous stem professors and the education community the math framework ought to promote algebra for 8th graders who are ready for it  
1	please support adoption of the new california mathematics framework the new framework supports access for all students to rigorous mathematics  
-1	california public schools need more academic rigor and access to higher math classes san franciscos failed experiment of removing access to algebra 1 in middle school hurt the very students the district was trying to help and made it difficult for students to study higher level math please do not make the same mistake at a state level based on the sfusd math curriculum make algebra 1 available for middle school students   
-1	the california mathematics framework modeled after the san francisco detracking mathematics curriculum should not be adopted the evidence from the san francisco experiment does not support that detracking improved mathematics results and outcomes for our students  both equity priority students of color and advanced students both did worse under detracking this policy instead set back thousands of students who would have otherwise had the opportunity to take advance math in high school and prepare for stem courses at the undergraduate level our schools must support all students those at the top and the bottom and no one is served by holding back those students with the interest aptitude commitment and focus to take advanced math algebra in 7th or 7th grade and filling additional in their high school years with calculus california is amazing but the continue to be a state of wide open opportunity and cuttingedge technical careers we must offer public school students the most challenging math curriculum they can handle we can achieve the equity many hope might come from this policy far more directly with prop 13 reform and higher overall school funding returning our uc funding to historic levels and expanding the number of seats at uc campuses and building new ones this policy just holds the whole state back and gives up on the hard work of making california the land of opportunity again

-1	please dont waste money on yet another attempt to teach mathematics in case nobody noticed the principles of mathematics algebra and calculus have not changed in several centuries in case nobody noticed its downright criminal that our students understanding of mathematics has steadily deteriorated over the past 50 years we graduate high school students who cannot make change from a five dollar bill the self serving frauds who concocted this latest framework are the only ones who would benefit if you decide to pay for yet another attempt to reinvent the wheel  
-1	i have a son going into high school who attended k8 in sfusd in all these years he has not once been challenged in math and thats not per lack of motivation hes a straight a student he used to love math in elementary school but its been boring to him all through middle school and especially this past year in 8th grade math is now his least favorite subject even though he likes his math teacher am not impressed by what sfusd did to math this fall were having him leave sfusd in order to provide him a challenging academic environment if you dont challenge the students that want to be challenged you get sfusd a district where anyone with means takes their kids out by middle school and high school  
-1	the curriculum has never been evaluated in a peer reviewed study 
-1	the math framework must promote the success of our future leaders and technologists by encouraging the taking of advanced mathematics such as calculus the experiment in san francisco to not allow 8th graders to take algebra has failed do not repeat it state wide  
0	the option for children to learn algebra in 8th grade is important students who enroll in public schools present a range of abilities among the group are those who are ready and need the head start in mathematics my first child was enrolled in san franciscos gifted program was interested in math and i could afford to enroll him in sf state colleges summer algebra class the year he finished 5th grade he finished the program successfully learners should be given the option and holding them back is not a good idea not all parents are financially able to enroll their children in private schools public schools should serve all types of students  
-1	these recommendations are not sufficiently evidencebased and disadvantage lower and middle income students as an attendee of california public schools my classmates and i benefitted greatly from having access to algebra in 8th grade and having the opportunity to progress to calculus before the end of high school restricting access to algebra for 8th graders attending california public schools will widen the gap between public and private school students contributing to the death spiral of public schools in some areas and risks making california public school students less competitive than students from other states when they apply to to colleges   
-1	this framework takes us backwards by deemphasizing teaching algebra in 8th grade as part of a lager misguided approach to equity that believes that we achieve equity by removing opportunities from some rather than raising up others its backwards and will harm students and make us less competitive as a state and as a culture  
-1	my children have been adversely affected by not having algebra in middle school this lack of math instruction puts them at a disadvantage in high school and beyond i strongly support bringing algebra back to middle school level instruction  
-1	if students are ready for algebra in 8th grade they should have the opportunity to take the course even though it has been decades since middle school for me i was bored in middle school math however i or my parents didnt have the choice to challenge myself instead i coasted through 8th grade please vote no and please allow students the opportunity to take algebra when they are ready not on a set schedule thank you  
-1	this has not been evaluated in a peerreviewed study and does not promote 8th grade algebra more analysis and feedback are needed to see if this is an effective program  
-1	i am writing as a californian the parent of a son in ca public schools and the holder of a phd in pure mathematics i strongly oppose adoption of the nonsciencebased discredited math framework for ca public schools this framework is based on the same bad ideas that led to san francisco eliminating 8th grade algebra which undermined advancement opportunities for students interested in accelerated math while doing nothing to close achievement gaps a sane math framework ought to let students learn at their own pace and let those who are ready to move ahead do so without regimentation so they can achieve their full potential and not get bored moreover it ought to set standards of excellence in line with what we know can be done from international experience of bestinclass math education systems like that of singapore i urge the state to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new framework that addresses the points made here   and by the thousands of mathematicians and educational professionals who have signed open letters opposing the framework  
0	the basis for math success is vital and to ensure the success of future students in math stem and all sciences must have a common traditional basis for computation and math if some students dont succeed in math especially the more advanced forms of it that means that for those students some additional tutoring or practice in the subject is necessary if the 8th graders who are high achievers have the option to attend summer school or after school programs for advancement then that should ameliorate the issue but you have to make it clear that the solid basis of math is adequately taught and why are there budget cuts when our state has a surplus why do budget cuts always affect the teachers and students and not the administrators or school board members who have high salaries already i still allow my tax dollars to pay for education in my city because i believe in an informed citizenry working and voting on issues that affect me  
-1	i absolutely oppose removing algebra from the 8th grade curriculum as a public school student in san francisco sfusd my daughter struggled to obtain resources and opportunities to advance in mathematics she had to find ways to try and take algebra outside of the system in order to try and catch up enough to take calculus by 12th grade private school kids had no such struggle and were offered the curriculum in their schools this change in the name of equity really just hurts the people its ostensibly trying to help by putting roadblocks in the way of students who have fewer resources to try and get past them and by holding them back while the wealthy privileged have access to more advanced learning opportunities equity shouldnt mean lowering the bar to hold kids back to the lowest level it should mean raising up and helping the kids who need it  
-1	the state board of education should dispense with the proposed elimination of algebra in the eighth grade for high schoolers to be able to take the calculus ap ab they needed to have algebra in eighth grade to allow enough time for the preparatory coursework for the ap course if they want to take the calculus ap bc they would need to have taken algebra in seventh grade californias math curriculum should allow for this and allow children who are ready to take algebra in the seventh and eighth grade to do so having calculus in high school set up students in college to take more advanced math classes critical for stem majors   
-1	please dont disadvantage our children by not allowing them to take algebra in the 8th grade in order not to disadvantage my children one son took algebra and geometry in 9th grade and the other we paid 1000 for an algebra summer course we are lucky to have been able to ensure our kids werent disadvantaged but many cant our children have to be able to compete with others in states that allow algebra in the 8th grade

-1	the cmf v3 seems substantially the same as v2 which paints as acceptable the disastrous program implemented in sf which has driven middle class students from the public school system and worsened outcomes for lower ses students of color prof boaler has no business being anywhere near our states education system i am a staunch liberal but i cannot support a party that endorses pseudoscientific idealogoues like her or accepts her work please remove her and try again

-1	dear state board as a parent of sfusd which has denied middle school students the opportunity to take algebra and as a result has seen abysmal performance in math proficiency and enacted gross unnecessary roadblocks for students interested in stem education by forcing kids to take summer school or double up on math in one year it is a fools errand to impose this nonsensical framework onto the entire state if the goal is to find a path to retain motivated children and their families in ca public schools then do not adopt this framework families and kids who want their kids to pursue careers in stem would leave the public schools in droves and as a result the public school system will be more decimated you want to turn the tide on enrollment offer more rigor not less make more schools like magnate schools instead of watering down the most fundament discipline in stem education math finally jo boaler is a grifter who charges poor schools in ventura 5000 an hour by adopting this your legitimizing her grift and the public school system and the kids in the public schools in california will suffer as a result do not dumb down math  
-1	hello after having read the entire framework im shocked at how late kids are going to learn algebra and how few of them are going to combine some amount of basic memorization along with equally important collaborative and critical thinking strategies i grew up learning algebra in 8th grade in the late 90s in california and this has served me well throughout my nonmathematical career to apply critical thinking to my daily life and situations theres no reason in the framework as far as i can tell that this hybrid approach from the 90s isnt accessible to all students from all walks of life please reconsider approving this new framework thank you  
-1	our children need algebra in 8th grade to be competitive in the global economy stanford research has shown that keeping students on the same math track until high school has not affected student pass rates in the class or resulted in more black and brown students taking precalculus and other advanced math coursework the evidence is clear  we need to bring back algebra in middle school   
-1	i am incredibly disappointed that california is considering the proposed math standard is even being considered why not make california a place where 8th graders ready for algebra can take it instead it is looking to adopt a framework that hasnt been peer reviewed and could be seen to benefit the individual leading the recommendations lets raise the floor to allow all children to be ready to take 8th grade algebra not lower the ceiling  
-1	as the father of two schoolaged children i am appalled that the school board would consider removing algebra from the eighth grade curriculum while a high tide raises all ships a low tide can certainly lower them we shouldnt seek to reach teaching equality by curbing our childrens potential especially as families with means will push their children even further ahead in private school should this pass my and i would strongly consider removing our childen from the california public school system and will probably move to a state with better public schools   
-1	our students in california public schools are already behind in math when compared to other states not allowing students the opportunity to take algebra in 8th grade sets them back in highschool the san francisco unified math curriculum needs to change and include algebra for all 8th graders if 8th graders do not receive algebra they will be required to take extra math courses in highschool in order to graduate with calculus which if taken senior year helps keep their college applications competitive also students who wish to pursue a stem career will be required to take calculus in college and they need the exposure to the material in highschool the current san francisco unified curriculum should not be a standard for the state because it is flawed putting our public middle school students at a disadvantage san francisco unified needs to change their math curriculum to include 8th grade algebra and other school districts that offer 8th grade algebra should be allowed to continue to offer it   
-1	i do not agree with the proposed solution for mathematics for ca public schools this proposal will set back the primary economic engine behind the worlds 6th largest economy  our talented people   
-1	please do not adopt the youcubed math curriculum which prohibits 8th grade students from taking algebra the creator of this plan boaler financially benefits from a curriculum that has never been evaluated in a peerreviewed study this plan has been a proven failure in san francisco please you are smart people you know that this curriculum is a step backwards for the students in our state   
-1	please dont implement the proposed ca math framework these changes disadvantage the very people you are trying to help it has been a total failure at sfusd and will injure cas ability to compete in the future   
-1	my children were educated in the san francisco public schools removing algebra as an option for eighth graders is a disaster our kids already do horribly in math and my kids were gifted in math i had to find scholarships to private schools for them my daughter is now an engineer for whom math is a core requirement my son who was even more gifted in math now hates it as a result of so many years of boredom in his slow math classes before he got to private school if you want our children qualified for stem fields why on earth would you hold children back who are capable of moving forward you wouldnt hold varsity athletes back until their less coordinated peers catch up why hold back mathletes  
1	our students need competitive math skills to succeed bring back algebra in the 8th grade curriculum the solution is better math teaching in years 17 not dropping algebra china is not dumbing down their schools we should not either get better teachers and better train the ones we have dont let nonstem or nonmath qualified teachers teach math  
-1	dont allow the adoption of youcubed curriculum which have never been peer reviewed dont hold back the achievement of californias brightest youngsters by denying them the ability to take advanced classes  
-1	i oppose any attempt to remove algebra i as an optional extra math for 8th graders 8th graders need to take algebra so that they can take calculus in 12th grade please do not approve any math curriculum that does not include algebra for those 8th graders who want to take it thanks you  
-1	we should be investing more resources to hire math teachers who can provide differentiated instruction including algebra in 8th grade or even younger if a student has the aptitude  
1	adopting the new mathematics framework would allow mathematics teachers throughout california to provide a more comprehensive inclusive and meaningful curriculum for the diverse k12 students within the state this would also allow for the support and implementation of pedagogical approaches that mathematics education literature has demonstrated is most effective in student learning   
-1	my comments are attached in file named k fuson changes on third draft 7 5 23 problems that need fixing in the third draft of the california math framework karen c fuson emerita professor northwestern university common core state standards feedback team author team of nbt and oa progressions contributor to the 2013 california math framework this version has corrected many issues and is much easier to read thanks for all of the hard work but there are still errors in this draft about what the ca ccss say about standard algorithms and the centrality of multiplication and division in grade 3 the framework correctly emphasizes that students need to develop understanding of multidigit operations but it confuses fluent use of a standard algorithm with the first use of a standard algorithm it repeatedly states that standard algorithms can only be introducedtaughtlearned in the grade at which the ca ccss say that students must use a standard algorithm fluently the ca ccss clearly state that students are to develop discuss and use efficient accurate and generalizable methods in the first year in which that kind of computation is introduced california ccss p 14 grade 1 students are to develop discuss and use efficient accurate and generalizable methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10 california ccss p 18 grade 2 students solve problems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction and they develop discuss and use efficient accurate and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in baseten notation using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations so in grade 1 and 2 in the california ccss some versions of standard algorithms which are efficient accurate and generalizable methods can and even must be developed but they should be done meaningfully and with drawings california ccss 1nbt4 add within 100 including adding a twodigit number and a onedigit number and adding a twodigit number and a multiple of 10 using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value properties of operations andor the relation ship between addition and subtraction relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used california ccss 2nbt7 add and subtract within 1000 using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value properties of operations andor the relationship between addition and subtraction relate the strategy to a written method the cmf nicely shows variations in multiplication standard algorithms as efficient accurate and generalizable methods the cmf needs to do the same for grade 1 and 2 accessible versions of standard algorithms that would enable california students to develop understand and explain general methods a description of these drawn from nctm materials are below on pages 4 to 6 this material could be added earlier in chapter 6 or just before the table about fluent use of standard algorithms therefore these changes need to be made to be consistent with the ca ccss chapter 6 lines 1563 to 1567 need to be omitted everyday mathematics offers guidance for families explaining how premature instruction in standard algorithms can often lead to erroneous and even harmful ideas students may come to believe that mathematics is mostly about memorizing that mathematics problems should be solved in a few minutes and that there is just one right way to solve a problem kcf this is false i carried out the fiveyear evaluation of everyday mathematics for max bell as requested by nsf teachers in everyday math allowed students to use their own methods but then taught the bad standard algorithms right before spring tests these opinions about standard algorithms arise from bad teaching and bad algorithms not from the fact that all standard algorithms are bad 1568 to 1594 also is false as seen above and needs to be replaced by the blue paragraph below note that the ca ccssm do not include standard algorithms in transitional kindergarten through grade three although there are standards addressing fluencies needed for proficiency in standard algorithms in later grades instead as shown in figure 631 the progression related to standard algorithms begins with the standard algorithm for addition and subtraction in grade four the algorithm for multiplication is addressed in grade five and the introduction of the standard algorithm for whole number division comes in grade six chapter seven addresses grade six replace with the ca ccssm do not call for fluency with standard algorithms in grades tkð3 so there is time to develop meanings for accessible standard algorithms with drawings in these grades the ca ccssm do say that firstgrade students develop discuss and use efficient accurate and generalizable methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10 california ccss p 14 and secondgrade students solve problems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction and they develop discuss and use efficient accurate and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in baseten notation using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations california ccss p 18 the ca ccssm place fluent use of standard algorithms at the grades indicated below in the table fluent use means without drawings or other visual representations so it is important to introduce sensemaking with drawings and easy variations of standard algorithms at earlier grades in chapter 3 there is now a lovely example and discussion in lines 456 to 476 about first graders using efficient flexible generalizable methods but the final two sentences are wrong and need to be removed the important and lovely discussion is correct but these sentences are false and are not needed note that while students in first grade do begin to add twodigit numbers they do so using strategies as distinguished from formal algorithms the ca ccssm intentionally place the standard algorithms for addition and subtraction in fourth grade 4nbt4 not true the ca ccssm place fluency with standard algorithms for addition and subtraction in fourth grade 4nbt4 a second major problem
1	im writing in support of the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools kindergarten through grade twelve this framework was written by professional educators of californias k12 public school educators who work with diverse students populations and who understand their students various needs when it comes to helping students make sense of mathematics and putting their learning into practical use the emphasis on developing students critical thinking and problem solving skills will benefit every students in all their academics studies and life beyond school equally important is the frameworks attention to culturally responsive teaching and recognizing the importance of acknowledging and valuing students diverse backgrounds and experiences  
1	i support the adoption of the new math framework it was written by a team of experts and educators over an extended period of time the new framework takes steps toward ensuring a more equitable and inclusive environment for math education for students from all different backgrounds i love that it focuses on truly understanding mathematical concepts rather than memorization it develops students critical thinking and problem solving skills it is critical that we adopt frameworks that recognize students diverse experiences and is culturally responsive it is also important that it includes computer science and data literacy since these skills are critical in todays job market i urge you to support and adopt the 2023 math framework  
-1	i write this letter to oppose the proposed california math framework my comments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in the spring 2023 issue of education next californias new math framework doesnt add up the frameworks stated purpose is to support implementation of the california common core state standards for mathematics ca ccssm the framework undermines the standards in some cases directly contradicting them the framework states attaining fluency with multiplication and division within 100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students work how can that be if students know multiplication facts from memory at the end of third gradeñas stipulated in the state standardswhy would they still be working on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades but the claim is repeated acquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and development continues in grades four and five pg 83 note that californias 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same wording to describe third grade expectations multiplication and division are new concepts in grade three and reaching fluency with these operations within 100 represents a major portion of students work by the end of grade three students also know all products of two onedigit numbers from memory 3oa7  a major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in upper elementary grades what a step backwards what does fluent mean the 2013 framework offers a clear definition consistent with other states that adopted common core the word fluent is used in the standards to mean ôreasonably fast and accurate and possessing the ability to use certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge does not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more complex problems the new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis on speed the california common core math standards call for students to demonstrate an understanding of and the ability to use the standard algorithms of addition and subtraction by the end of fourth grade multiplication by the end of fifth grade and division by the end of sixth grade these are culminating standards not ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught the proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching of standard algorithms before the culminating grade a false interpretation explicitly debunked by jason zimba one of the common core coauthors if this framework is adopted californias students will encounter the standard division algorithm for the first time in sixth grade years after most of the world has attained mastery please reject the proposed framework  
1	i am a 30 year veteran teacher with national board certification as an early childhood generalist i also currently a numeracy interventionist with the los angeles unified school district and formerly a primary promise math intervention teacher i strongly urge you to approve the 2023 california mathematics framework it is imperative that the state update this vital document which will drive curriculum and instruction in our great state we must support teachers in the belief that all student are capable success in mathematics equity and inclusion are vital for the continued success of our state so it is of vital importance that the board take a stand in this matter by adopting this document additionally we must support teachers in outdate practices such as timed tests and focus their instruction towards a deeper understanding of number sense especially in the primary grades i thank you for your consideration of my opinion   
1	this new framework needs to be supported to promote equity in mathematic achievement and the foundation necessary for children to feel capable of achieving high levels of mathematics and being data literate in a data driven world   
-1	concerning the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework it appears that california wants to further dumb down its education for the purpose of ensuring that black students do not feel less intelligent this is equity meaning no one advances past another unfortunately we cannot be made equally intelligent instead schools can only ensure that no one has the opportunity to become more so this equity push will come at a cost to america america doesnt need every one of its citizens to be pros at math but it needs some to be pros at it technology drives our civilization now not the mule we need smart people and we need our schools to make them smart not to make them happy  
1	please adopt 
-1	1 the equitythemed math framework is playing with fire by conducting an ideological experiment on our next generation 2 america needs competent engineers scientists mathematicians and other stem talents more than ever we simply cant allow public education to keep spinning downwards 3 the antimerit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education take home message when you need surgery in hospital you wouldnt want equityhired or diversityhired doctors to do surgery for you you want to have the most competent doctors think about your own future and your owns kids future thanks a lot  
-1	i propose that the state of california require the fully informed consent by the parents of any child whose school is placing himher into an alternative math course to algebra 2  
1	i urge adoption of the revised draft of the mathematics framework this revised document provides longawaited guidance for educators and districts it prioritizes equitable teaching strategies and retains a focus on social justice it presents a solid research base while also acknowledging the need for further study of high school pathways its focus on big ideas provides a way for educators to plan and implement instruction effectively the three dimensional schema provides a conceptual frame for the why drivers of investigation how standards for mathematical practice and what content connections of mathematics instruction bringing coherence to how we think about plan and implement learning experiences for our students we have learned from past efforts we know more about how students learn and the contexts in and conditions under which they thrive we know more about effective teaching practices this knowledge is reflected in the revised document the mathematics framework in its latest iteration is future forward foretelling powerful mathematics teaching and learning ahead  
1	please adopt the new mathematics framework this will help assure more equity in math education   
1	i support passage of the ca mathematics framework i believe this document supports equity in mathematics for all students in our diverse state it is critical to assure all students have equal opportunity to learn   
-1	oppose 
1	i support the 2023 mathematics framework for california public shoools k12  
-1	the new high school data science pathway is deeply flawed it is intended as a route for students who are challenged by algebra to learn some concepts related to real world data science in a less mathematically focused way in principle this may be a reasonable goal for some students but the actual curriculum here isnt much more than a repeat of data representation ideas from earlier grades it utterly fails to build the conceptual framework for students to apply mathematical  quantitative reasoning to both abstract and real world physical phenomena more directly students who study this pathway instead of algebra ii  integrated math iii will be hopelessly behind their peers when they enter colleges and universities in california or elsewhere it is deeply ironic that this curriculum is called introduction to data science when any students entering any university of california campus from this pathway will have to take at least two algebra  precalculus classes before other prerequisites for the introductory data sciences courses this will negatively impact timetodegree and college readiness for potentially thousands of students most worrying i fear that the california high schools with fewer resources will be tempted to offer the data science pathway instead of algebra ii  integrated math iii students at such high schools are already seriously disadvantaged this policy will only serve to increase the inequality and disadvantage those students now suffer sincerely todd kemp phd professor of mathematics founding faculty of the halicioglu data science institute uc san diego  
1	to state board of education president dr linda darlinghammond re support for the mathematics framework revised draft for sbe consideration as a middle school mathematics teacher for 36 years and the president of the california math councilnorth section i am urging the state board of education to adopt the revised draft mathematics framework it will create a foundation for schools and districts to build upon as they strengthen their mathematics programs to ensure success in math for all students especially as we are striving to support all learners to develop deep mathematical understanding and accelerate learning postpandemic the revised draft mathematics framework supports a modernized mathematics sequence which offers multiple pathways that provide mathematically rich and rigorous options for students through content that expands views about what mathematics is how it is vital to their lives and why they should learn it a pedagogy that provides access for all students to learn rigorous mathematics regardless of race gender culture religion background disability or learning needs and a safe and inclusive learning environment that celebrates the diversity of mathematics and mathematicians i believe our students deserve to have an organized delivery system of mathematics education and i believe our teachers deserve training to support the needs of all students this revised draft mathematics framework provides guidance to our mathematical education community in order to support our administrators coaches teachers and parents with the structure pathways and decisionmaking policies that our students need now please adopt the revised draft mathematics framework so we can encourage inspire and support all students to appreciate the beauty and importance of mathematics in their lives professionally yours mary ann sheridan middle school mathematics teacher 36 years california math council north president induction program coordinator  
-1	the proposed math curriculum has potential downsides including weakening foundational skills reduced problemsolving abilities inadequate preparation for higher education diminished international competitiveness exacerbated education disparities and challenges in teacher preparedness weaker foundations can hinder students career prospects in stem fields while reduced problemsolving skills limit their abilities in various disciplines inadequate preparation for higher education may hinder success in fields requiring strong mathematical foundations the countrys international competitiveness may suffer as graduates are less equipped to compete in research innovation and economic growth disadvantaged students may face additional barriers perpetuating inequality teacher preparedness and professional development may be challenging impacting effective adaptation to the new curriculum  
-1	the proposed math curriculum in the education system can have several potential downsides 1 weakening foundational skills the proposed math curriculum may result in a diminished emphasis on foundational math skills these skills are crucial for advanced mathematical concepts and realworld applications weaker foundations can hinder students abilities to pursue careers in stem fields and may limit their overall mathematical competence 2 reduced problemsolving abilities rigorous math education fosters critical thinking and problemsolving skills by diluting the curriculum students may miss out on opportunities to develop their analytical and logical reasoning abilities this can have longterm consequences as problemsolving skills are essential in various academic disciplines and in everyday life 3 limited preparedness for higher education a less rigorous math curriculum may inadequately prepare students for the challenges they will encounter in higher education many disciplines including engineering computer science economics and physics require strong mathematical foundations students may struggle to succeed in these fields if they havent received a rigorous math education in their earlier years 4 impact on international competitiveness this curriculum may negatively impact a countrys competitiveness on the global stage in an increasingly interconnected world proficiency in mathematics is crucial for scientific research technological innovation and economic growth this framework will impact out state of california and then usa will produce graduates who are less equipped to compete internationally in these domains 5 disparity in education quality the proposed math curriculum may exacerbate existing disparities in education quality students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be disproportionately affected as they often rely on education systems to provide them with opportunities to bridge the socioeconomic gap weaker math education can perpetuate inequality by limiting their access to highpaying careers and advanced educational opportunities 6 teacher preparedness and professional development implementing this math curriculum may require significant changes in teaching methodologies instructional resources and professional development for teachers adequate training and support for educators are essential to ensure they can effectively adapt their teaching strategies insufficient preparation can hinder teachers ability to deliver quality math education further compromising students learning outcomes  
1	i am in full support of the adoption of the revised draft mathematics framework which recommends researchbased approaches that  provide access and future success for all students through creating a meaningful and rigorous mathematics experience beginning with early childhood education  encourage equitable outcomes through instructional design that includes teaching big ideas using open tasks teaching toward social justice supporting students questions and conjectures and prioritizing reasoning and justification  propose broadening the mathematics pathways offered so more students can learn algebra and take higherlevel math coursework through a high school course sequence that allows for more student choice the revised draft also recommends shifting from the use of remedial classes to a focus on acceleration and enrichment opportunities to better support all students educators districts schools parents and families use the ca mathematics framework to guide their math instructional programs design professional development to build capacity across district systems inform curriculum selection and advocate for researchbased math instruction that meets the needs of all learners i encourage the sbe to vote to approve the 2023 mathematics framework to support ca districts in moving forward and creating a strong foundation for the field of mathematics education in california for the next eight years until the next framework is written and adopted districts are ready to adopt new curriculum materials better aligned to the ccssm but need the new framework to move forward with this process i encourage the sbe to support california students and mathematics education statewide by voting to approve the 2023 mathematics framework  
-1	the proposed mathematics framework is a looming disaster for california students if approved it will further sink california k12 mathematics education below the lowly depths to which it has already sunk based on my 46 years of experience working in the most mathematically intense segment of the aerospace industry i can assure you that the image of mathematics held by the authors of this framework is so alien to the reality of mathematics as it is practiced by those of us who actually do it for a living that it is barely recognizable let alone a model for mathematics instruction first of all math has nothing whatsoever do with fashionable eduspeak obsessions such as race gender sexual orientation ethnicity culture etc in fact several of the attributes of mathematics that make it so appealing to its practitioners worldwide are that it is universal deals with truths that cannot be refuted is undemocratic does not depend on majority consensus for its veracity and excludes appeals to authority as grounds for the acceptance of its conclusions another aspect of the framework that i find particularly objectionable is the false assertion permeating the framework that math has to be relevant to students life experiences in order to be learned by them nothing could be farther from the truth the fact is that if competently taught math is seen by most students to be an intrinsically fascinating subject in its own right no matter which side of the tracks they call home and this coming from me a lifetime practitioner of applied rather than pure mathematics california colleges of engineering are enrolling higher and higher proportions of foreign students who do not suffer from the handicap imposed upon american students by advocates of the concepts embodied in the proposed k12 mathematics framework because fewer and fewer california students are acquiring the essential traditional math skills in k12 necessary to handle twentyfirst century engineering curricula at greatest risk from the proposed framework are students from poor families because their parents cannot afford to send them to kumon or the russian school of mathematics ð private businesses that thrive on successfully providing students with learning that compensates for the inadequacies of public school mathematics instruction a state of affairs that also contributes significantly to the skewing of statistical studies of mathematics education outcomes in favor of wealthier students california deserves better i urge you to reject the proposed mathematics framework  
1	i am excited for the change to math education that this framework could bring i appreciate the focus on supporting educators and the focus on creating equitable spaces for all kids to access strong math instruction its time to modernize math and i believe whats proposed in this framework is a great start  
-1	we oppose the new california math curriculum that infuses social political beliefs and subjective viewpoints into the math curriculum math should remain objective opinions and beliefs on social and political issues have no place in math curriculum with less than 40 of california students proficient in math  implementing and mastering the math content standards seems an urgent matter politicians should demonstrate they care more about facts than feelings especially when it comes to an objective subject matter freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four if that is granted all else follows _ george orwell 1984  
-1	only 33 of students in grades 38 and 11 achieved math proficiency teaching math for social justice will undoubtedly lead to further declines in academic performance and perpetuate the academic achievement gaps to solve the public education crisis we need to bring back rigorous instruction keep up academic standards and revive merit   
-1	i believe the proposed calif math framework cmf would be harmful to students especially harmful to black and latino children i say this as a a retired uc davis professor who has taught math statistics and computer science and b as a lifelong activist on behalf of urms underrepresented minorities starting with my work in 1968 on the congressional campaign of myrlie evers a historic black figure my term as chair of the ucd faculty affirmative action committee and so on i make the following brief points 1 the document is horribly biased as seen in its failure to correct numerous serious factual errors pointed out after the earlier version was released the failure to correct factual errors cannot be anything but deliberate it has more than 25 citations of the research of one single person with no references to work by critics of the proposal no critics were members of the advisory committee the main concession made by the revised document seems to be mollifying parents who were worried their children would not be able to take calculus those of us with broader concerns about the curriculum as a whole were ignored 2 the negative impact on urm children who are the most vulnerable in our society would be devastatingthe courses in data science and the like would be watered down to the point of uselessness see below and urms would be shunted into these classes which would be dominated by urms the classes would be known to the students as black and latino math a horribly stigmatizing situation this ideologicallybased playing with urm lives is absolutely unconscionable 3 i have long experience teaching statistics and can say unequivocally that the data science curricula would be useless yes one can certainly teach data science without calculus but algebra 2 is an indispensable prerequisite data science is meaningless without a firm grasp of the concept of the slope of a line ive looked at the lausd version of a data science curriculum and is both superficial and riddled with conceptual errors the ucla lecturer who created the curriculum has also made serious conceptual errors in a youtube video on college admissions 4 that last point illustrates a more general principle data science is a highly nuanced field which is easy to misuse even if the curriculum were revised to require algebra 2 it would be quite difficult to obtain teachers with the needed depth in ds a short training course would not suffice im a californian born and raised with a lifetime devotion to teaching i have even taught municipal esl courses and a brief supplementary math course for 5thgraders at a local elementary school and ive been fortunate to have won some teaching awards ive thought long and hard about how young people learn math especially urms and it pains me to see california kids being treated this way please do not approve this plan  
1	finally a way of teaching math that gives everyone a chance this framework is an absolute gamechanger for equity in math education  and isnt learning meant to be creative inspiring thoughtprovoking and empowering for all not a memory test often inapplicable to everyday reallife situations if i had not been lucky enough to have a math teacher who saw some potential in me when other teachers had given up and taught me using more creative methods i never would have achieved the level of success in my exams and my career as i did  as well as an unshakable sense of selfbelief and confidence in myself i had a number of school friends with the same lowincome background as me who were not so lucky they found themselves stuck in an outdated elitist system that judged them from day one and offered them no opportunity to recognise or reach their true potential for these reasons i support this framework 100  and it would be a tragedy if it were not to be passed   
-1	to the california state board of education i strongly urge you to reject the proposed revision to the mathematics framework for california public schools the proposed 2023 framework will substantially reduce how well students in california will learn math this negative impact will be felt most significantly by minorities and the poor whose only access to education is that provided by the public schools as an engineering manager in silicon valley for over four decades i have observed over time a decreasing percentage of qualified candidates for engineering jobs who had received their k12 education in the united states rather than improve this situation the proposed revision is a long step in the wrong direction one that will deny many poor and minority students the opportunity to be hired into highpaying jobs in engineering and technology in the best interest of californias students i urge you to reject the proposed revision to the mathematics framework for public schools sincerely harry j levinson hjl lithography saratoga ca  
-1	ca seems to be all set to make exactly the same disastrous mistake with math that the us made for 40 years with reading ð choosing an ideological approach with very weak evidence and ignoring a strong evidencebased approach in that instance the state like the rest of the us went down the whole languagebalanced literacy path rather than the strong evidencebased science of reading path it is pertinent to note in this context that while ny has apologized for its use of balanced literacy and has committed to science of reading ca persists in using its failed methods to teach reading so i suppose one should not be surprised that ca with some of the lowest math achievement in the nation now intends to make matters worse with this dumbing down of math standards and the insertion of equity and social justice rather than math achievement as its guiding star the framework makes claims that are blatantly false such as ignoring research on the importance of math fluency ie memorization of key facts and procedures claiming that reaching fluency with multiplication and division within 100 represents a major portion of upper elementary grade students work whereas the common core standards actually requires this fluency by third grade claiming that having students invent algorithms for basic operations is productive struggle rather than a proven waste of time etc ad nauseum brian conrad stanford math professor has analyzed the citations in the framework and shows that the findings of many studies are misrepresented an analysis of the citations also shows that the actual best math ed practices are not cited in the framework ð instead ideological and weak evidence is given priority proof is in this excerpt from    the what works clearinghouse housed within the federal institute of education sciences publishes practice guides for educators the guides aim to provide concise summaries of highquality research on various topics a panel of experts conducts a search of the research literature and screens studies for quality following strict protocols experimental and quasiexperimental studies are favored because of their ability to estimate causal effects the panel summarizes the results linking each recommendation to supporting studies the practice guides present the best scientifically sound evidence on causal relationships in teaching and learning how many of the studies cited in the practice guides are also cited in the framework to find out i searched the framework for citations to the studies cited by the four practice guides most relevant to kð12 math instruction here are the results assisting students struggling with mathematics intervention in the elementary grades 2021 0 out of 43 studies teaching strategies for improving algebra knowledge in middle and high school students 2015 revised 2019 0 out of 12 studies improving mathematical problem solving in grades 4 through 8 2012 0 out of 37 studies developing effective fractions instruction for kindergarten through 8th grade 2010 1 out of 22 studies end of excerpt in short the framework is an ideological document that will push ca students even further down their already abysmal performance levels who will suffer affluent parents and asians of all income levels will move heaven and earth and use outside resources to make sure their children learn math to the level needed they will learn math untainted by social justice propaganda and equity dumbing down it is the low income students this framework so piously claims to want to help who will be further crushed by it  
-1	the math framework revision is based on gravely flawed research or in some cases no research at all the framework recommends fairly drastic changes that are counterintuitive and therefore the burden of proof falls on the recommenders to justify the changes i believe that burden has not been met the changes are not innocuous i believe they will hurt all populations including advanced learners and underserved communities the treatment of certain subjects in the proposed high school courses do not satisfy the rigorous requirements the uc system demands students of those subjects will be unwittingly and undeservedly unprepared for college i am a proponent of progressive education but it must be based on solid research this framework must be rejected at this stage i would hope that the next draft be given to a different set of authors who might be more capable of understanding the existing academic literature   
-1	for the record i am prounion antiracist a democratic prolgbtq antiprivatization and 100 an academic who values truth above all other virtues the mathematics framework for california public schools is still riddled with citation errors the authors claims are not supported by valid evidence i have been a math teacher in sfusd for several years now this is what ive seen over the past 10 years an increased number of students are entering 9th grade without having their multiplication facts memorized without the ability to perform operations with positive and negative integers decimals and fractions without the ability to solve onestep twostep and mutistep equations even with integers and without the ability to work independently this has had a catastrophically negative effect on high school mathematics the achievement gap has dramatically grown and so has the bipolarity within our classes were now forced to differentiate our instruction over multiple years students who are entering 9th grade with less than a 5th grade level of math competency are grouped with students who are ready for precalculus no one is getting the time practice and attention they need to thrive  
-1	math education is essential to competence of individuals and competitiveness of our state and nation please dont mess with math education with toxic politics of any kind please keep in mind math education in this state is already near the bottom in this nation thanks to your toxic politics in last few decades

1	as chair of adults learning mathematics alm   an international research forum and trustee of the joint mathematics council of the united kingdom l would like to support the ideas developed in this mathematics framework and guidance alm researchers and practioners work with adults who for many reasons have had poor experiences with mathematics at school they build their teaching and learning interventions on the notions of relevance to learners life experiences and social justice using this approach brings mathematics to life in a real and tangible way which motivates and reignites interest in learning the approaches to teaching outlined in this framework reflects these ideas and exemplifies how mathematics role in dealing with real and current challenges  
-1	im a once math major now working in techhealthcare and i credit that largely to the high quality high expectations math education i had access to as a child in california however since 2012 the fraction of 13 year olds taking algebra has declined from 34 to 24 the proposed framework is a step backwards and poorly researched im pleased with some of the changes ð some culture war language was removed explicit support for san franciscos detracking experiments was removed and the recommendations to detrack without acceleration were softened following debunking of the research that initially prompted them and after the authors of research that was misrepresented spoke out however the fixes are very ad hoc and leave the framework inconsistent the language around tracking is especially incoherent the framework favors grouping in which students are assigned to classes of their skill level but its not considered tracking as its not permanent but authors seem to have reservation about this as the framework pushes to delay grouping as late as possible ð see productive strategies for teaching diverse students this is justified on the basis that engagement can fluctuate significantly during adolescent years but that would suggest grouping should be delayed until adulthood bizarrely immediately after this remark it suggests that high achieving students should be able to to accelerate at any time but doesnt distinguish that from grouping the framework also discourages tracking compared to pathways because tracking locks in students to a certain set of courses in their future later it recommends that students be placed into pathways which are sets of courses students plan to take in the future based on ability and interest the recommendations around this topic simply put are very confused students are individuals who vary from one another and any kind of one size fits all approach is silly and will fail some of the children grouping should begin as soon as they show any differences in educational needs im a once math major now working in techhealthcare and i credit that largely to the high quality high expectations math education i had access to as a child in california however since 2012 the fraction of 13 year olds taking algebra has declined from 34 to 24 the proposed framework is a step backwards and poorly researched im pleased with some of the changes ð some culture war language was removed explicit support for san franciscos detracking experiments was removed and the recommendations to detrack without acceleration were softened following debunking of the research that initially prompted them and after the authors of research that was misrepresented spoke out however the fixes are very ad hoc and leave the framework inconsistent the language around tracking is especially incoherent the framework favors grouping in which students are assigned to classes of their skill level but its not considered tracking as its not permanent but authors seem to have reservation about this as the framework pushes to delay grouping as late as possible ð see productive strategies for teaching diverse students this is justified on the basis that engagement can fluctuate significantly during adolescent years but that would suggest grouping should be delayed until adulthood bizarrely immediately after this remark it suggests that high achieving students should be able to to accelerate at any time but doesnt distinguish that from grouping the framework also discourages tracking compared to pathways because tracking locks in students to a certain set of courses in their future later it recommends that students be placed into pathways which are sets of courses students plan to take in the future based on ability and interest the recommendations around this topic simply put are very confused students are individuals who vary from one another and any kind of one size fits all approach is silly and will fail some of the children grouping should begin as soon as they show any differences in educational needs

-1	ca and sbe are becoming more and more ridiculous math is math science is science do not politicize everythingas  someone experienced the cultural revolution in china what the liberals in the us are doing are exactly what what had been done during the cultural revolution we all know by now how thing turned outstopping destroying a system that had made america a great country that it is  
1	i am in support of bringing this new framework for more inclusive math education as a woman from the stem field a silicon valley based techimpact investor and community builderleader for positive inclusive change in society i firmly believe this is a key moment to evolve the ways in which we teach math and other stem subjects so that they are more inclusive and leave no child behind our state has a long way to go before we achieve educational equity and equal opportunity for all children especially for girls and children of color and this framework could be a great step in that direction  
1	 mathematics instruction in california can be more effective and equitable in many ca districts current teaching practices have resulted in only onethird of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures across the state additionally most students are being pushed out of highlevel pathways at a young age lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with outdated methods using narrow procedural questions this has had real consequences today less than half of california students satisfy ag requirements thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and careers california has insufficient educators qualified to work in stem it has to hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year math education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success preventing firstgeneration collegebound students black and latine students students with disabilities and lowincome immigrants from gaining entry to 4year colleges and universities and highpaying stem careers these programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which use standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude black students from gifted classrooms and relegate english learner students into lowlevel educational pathways at an early age these tests often given in elementary school have been used to sort label students as those who are good at math and those who are not and often determine who and who are not college material the revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics students will be taught through rich engaging problems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections pathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take higherlevel math coursework a mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice students will be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve replacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into lowlevel remedial classes  with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more students schools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years based on extensive scientific evidence and have shown higher and more equitable outcomes decades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for math instruction methods that are creative inclusive culturally responsive challenging and affirming for all students and that engage students more effectively strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning think critically and progress at their own pace the revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and five writers and has gone through a twoyear process of public comments and revisions as of april 2023 over 66 organizations and 2800 educators researchers and parents signed a letter of support for the california math framework they include the california county offices of education the california mathematics council the national council for teachers of mathematics nctm the national council for supervisors of mathematics ncsm just equations todos ð organization for excellence and equity in mathematics education trustwest center for equity for english learners at loyola marymount university california partnership for math and science education

1	as a former elementary and secondary mathematics teacher a current education researcher and teacher educator and a parent i write to share my support of the ca framework research shows that when students have access to highquality curricular resources and pedagogy  as is recommended by the framework they do better in mathematics in terms of achievement outcomes participation patterns and success in mathematics pathways longterm the approach outlined in the framework is equitable effective conceptual and empowering for students the framework will support ca mathematics teachers students and families with a more humanizing approach to mathematics that supports students to develop deep conceptual understanding of content to connect it to their lives and to other subjects and to author their own ideas

-1	dear members of the board of education i am writing to express my concerns regarding certain educational frameworks that have been implemented and their potential ramifications on the quality of public education in our state as a concerned citizen invested in the wellbeing of our education system i believe it is crucial to address these issues to ensure the future success of our students firstly i would like to draw your attention to the concept of an antimerit statewide framework while i understand the importance of promoting equality in education it is essential to strike a balance between providing equal opportunities and maintaining high academic standards lowering standards in the name of equal outcomes could potentially compromise the quality of education our students receive i kindly request that the board of education carefully considers the longterm effects of any policy changes and strives to find a middle ground that promotes both equality and excellence in education secondly i would like to emphasize the increasing need for competent engineers scientists mathematicians and other stem talents in our society the advancements and challenges of the modern world necessitate a strong focus on stem education it is crucial that our public education system provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge in these fields therefore i urge the board of education to prioritize and invest in quality stem education ensuring that our students are wellprepared to tackle the demands of the future lastly i would like to express my reservations regarding an equitythemed math framework while it is important to address systemic inequalities and foster inclusive learning environments it is equally essential to maintain a rigorous and balanced approach to mathematics education incorporating diverse perspectives and reallife applications in math can enhance students understanding and engagement however it is imperative to ensure that any equityfocused frameworks do not compromise the development of fundamental mathematical skills i kindly request the board of education to approach these frameworks with careful consideration and maintain a strong emphasis on mathematical excellence while promoting equity objectives i believe that our education system plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of our society by addressing these concerns and finding a balance between equality and excellence we can provide our students with a highquality education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities they will face thank you for your time and consideration i trust that the board of education will give due attention to these concerns and take appropriate actions to ensure the best possible educational outcomes for our students sincerely nirit luchans parent  
1	dear california state board of education new classrooms is a national nonprofit on a mission to personalize education through the development and advocacy of innovative and competencybased solutions this includes innovative learning models which support teachers by integrating precise diagnostics high quality content embedded formative assessment and personalized personal pathways that span multiple grade levels these models are designed to better meet the unique strengths and needs of every student we commend the state of california for incorporating critical changes into the third draft of the mathematics framework this revision represents a significant departure from traditional uniform onesizefitsall gradelevel textbook based learning it now includes a vital gradeband structure for k5 68 and 912 this framework should be used across all aspects of the system to unlock personalized competencybased designs and instructional programs that meet all of californias students where they are and provide them with a personalized pathway to college and career readiness we are happy to lend our support to the adoption and promotion of this framework __ michael s watson vice president policy and advocacy new classrooms  
1	please adopt the new math framework i am a veteran teacher of over 20 years and am in full support of the new math framework thank you  
1	to whom it may concern i am a high school math teacher in chino ca i have taught since 2011 i have been teaching im1 since 2014 so my comments are limited to that area since it has been my focus for the past decade i hope that the comments ive written are read with the understanding that all we want to do as teachers is make it so that students learn remember what they learn and we have some fun in the process too covid definitely made things clear for us all and sent many packing i am still here so are my colleagues lets work together to figure out the best way to have kids learn math here are my commentsthoughts  page 5 line 122 create equations to describe situations can weave into the framework the need to understand how creating an equation can lead to creating a function and thus the difference between the two thanks page 6 line 131 and 132 they compare and contrast linear and exponential functions distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change are you referring to arithmetic and geometric sequences without using those terms why are teachers bothered by them please be specific although i realize this is a framework and inherently general i feel that arithmetic and geometric sequences and subsequently the idea of recursive and explicit forms are a pillar within mathematics i please refers to them explicitly no pun intended to help emphasize their importance page 6 line 139 assessing how a model fits data they use regression techniques to describe can someone somewhere maybe not here in the framework please talk about the difference between a line of fit done manually using two points a line of best fit done electronically using a graphing calculator like desmos and the line of regression maybe a general statement acknowledging that in mathematics we use multiple terms to describe the same thing would suffice just a thought page 6 lines 143  147 due to the structure of the integrated pathway and the natural emphasis math teachers tend to put on algebra i feel it is necessary to make it 1000 clear that geometry must be an essential standard in mathematics 1 too often i have seen geometry placed on the back burner or referred to as a nice to know standard the geometry is where the beauty and art in mathematics comes alive teachers dont know how to teach it this way we need materials that take students from order could vary constructing a triangle to transforming a triangle in the coordinate plane to using constructions and transformations to prove triangles congruent teachers are not teaching it that way they are compartmentalizing these topics and its a missed opportunity no one in public education taught it to me in this way truly we need to reeducate our educators and get them to buy into the idea that this will have more meaning to our students and therefore translate to deeper understanding and long term retention its lofty but ive experienced it in micro moments in the classroom page 12 line 313 please remove the word cancellation i refrain from saying this word to my students i use the word simplify because cancellation refers to xx cancelling each other out when in fact they are simplifying to 1 please use simplify instead just my two cents  
-1	 the belief that if all students were equal discrimination would cease to exist is an exercise in stupidity the cure would be worse than the disease imagine a world with eight billion exactly the same equal people dumb people have a very difficult time becoming smarter so to achieve equity everyone not already a dolt would need to be educated to become doltish evidently eradicating discrimination requires leveling the playing field this seems to be the thrust of the 2023 mathematics framework artificially holding back advanced students benefits no one but harms all in an attempt to keep failing math students from feeling bad they propose holding advanced students back this will not achieve the desired effect failing students will still feel bad about themselves held back students are likely to feel extremely angry at the handicapping the indoctrination of social justice and identity politics are not math and when embedded in the curriculum deprive all of a math education the state board of educations advancing of this math framework has an agenda opposed to merit and excellence more than likely theyve imbibed their own kool aid  
-1	there is nothing wrong with meritbased math instruction the achievement gap problem has been intractable because of underlying problemsbe they social or economic teaching for equity does more harm than good especially since there is no adequately proven record for it too many families have already been negatively impacted particularly asian americans more research needs to be done before a radical approach like teaching for equity is adopted given that students are doing poorly and that resources are finite we must teach to bring out the very best in each student that means restoring merit the antimerit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education the promise of america is one of equal opportunities not equal outcomes america needs competent engineers scientists mathematicians and other stem talents more than ever we simply cant allow public education to keep spinning downwards talented students should be acknowledged for their ability to rise above instead of being held back for the sake of others the equitythemed math framework is playing with fire by conducting an ideological experiment on our next generation my siblings and children have been subjects of untold numbers of failed education experiments including busing racial quotas dream schools and a multimillion dollar federal consent decree  
-1	my children have attended school in fremont unified school district during elementary school there is no option for accelerated math learning my kids were offered differentiation and deeper learning these options are wholly inadequate and unchallenging it is bad enough that kids that are good at math have to be bored in math for all of elementary school but to extend this to middle and high school is ridiculous the current educational system convinced my kids that they didnt like math although they are all very good at it my middle child is going to be a senior this year and she finally started enjoying math in high school when she was being challenged by the course work teachers in reality do not offer more challenging math work to kids who are good at math the revised plan is only paying lip service to advance learners without any substance california will surely continue to decline in math achievement when you take your best students and offer them the opportunity to tutor failing students rather than let them learn  
-1	math is a basic skill and foundation of science it has nothing to do with justice the antimerit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education america needs competent engineers scientists mathematicians and other stem talents we simply cant allow public education to keep spinning downwards  
1	i strongly support the idea of teaching for equity and engagement which lays out the following five components of equitable math education 1 plan teaching around big ideas 2 use open engaging tasks 3 teach toward social justice 4 invite student questions and conjectures 5 prioritize reasoning and justification this is how math education supports democracy as a veteran of over 40 years of teaching mathematics at the secondary level i found this to help combat math anxiety and improve student mathematical performance please do not change this thank you sincerely h william marthinsen  
1	dear state board of education mathematics instruction can be more effective and engaging to do so math must be creative inclusive culturally responsive challenging and affirming for all students it must be based on strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning think critically and progress at their own pace jo boaler and a committee of educators and writers have gone through a vetted two year process and their proposed new math framework deserves our support sincerely tim zalunardo executive director educational services santa rosa city schools  
1	all children deserve access to a highquality mathematics education i support the adoption of proposed revisions to the ca math framework ca students from all backgrounds deserve to be visible in the curriculum and that includes mathematics instruction detractors targeting these proposed revisions are the same people advancing book bans of lgbtq literature and the teaching of our countrys true history which includes contributions by black native american latinx and asian americans dont let outsiders money and political agendas determine the future of california and its children students are counting on your vote to affirm recommendations supported by the national council of teachers of mathematics just equations todos and many other organizations that support equitable math instruction  
1	i think it is important we bring our math up to closer to the world standard and this seems like a good start it is important that people understand why they are learning something and how it effect them inclusion and diversity are important in all facets of education including but not limited to math

1	all children deserve access to a high quality mathematics education i support the adoption of proposed revisions to the ca math framework ca students from all backgrounds deserve to be visible in the curriculum and that includes mathematics instruction detractors targeting these proposed revisions are the same people advancing book bans of lgbtq literature and the teaching of our countrys true history which includes contributions by black native american latinx and asian americans   
1	i support the approval of the mathematics framework equity is an important goal in math education during my years in the classroom i was able to provide deep understanding to a wide variety of students enrolled in the same course at the same time their different ways of learning and understanding often benefited each other  the connection between more concrete and more abstract thinking became visible to everyone rather than the struggling students becoming mired in the concrete and the stronger students relying on memorization of procedures most of my students went on to good four year colleges including ucs and highly competitive private schools after high school when i saw them in the community or when they wrote to me they would tell me that they felt well prepared in a multilevel math class for their college curriculums another thing i would like to point out is that standardized tests aside from ibap tests arent a good measure of what students know because they are designed to compare students not as mastery tests given that current students had at least two disrupted academic years because of covid and dont forget that many lost family members andor experienced long illnesses of caregivers or themselves test outcomes are even more questionable than usual the point of math is that students learn it deeply enough to succeed in the next class and like math enough to continue taking it in college or using it in the workplace thus i reiterate my support of the framework which will help achieve that goal sincerely carol retired teacher  
1	i am in support of bringing this new framework for more inclusive math education as a woman from the stem field a silicon valley based techimpact investor and community builderleader for positive inclusive change in society i firmly believe this is a key moment to evolve the ways in which we teach math and other stem subjects so that they are more inclusive and leave no child behind our state has a long way to go before we achieve educational equity and equal opportunity for all children especially for girls and children of color and this framework could be a great step in that direction radhika shah

-1	what proposed here in the updated mathematics framework would further lower the standards on math education math is math the most logical and foundational discipline of science there is no middle ground you are either right or wrong adding social justice and other unrelated topics into math education is lunacy  
-1	lets leave politics and ideology out of science and math education what california needs is more rigorous math education not lower standard in the disguise of the socall social justice students do not grasp math concepts not because they are discriminated but because poor teacher and lack of investment you can keep fool yourself by lowering the standard to achieve socalled equity why dont you just say high school students only need to know 112 then suddenly every ethnic group is math proficient

1	it is essential that sbe adopt the new math framework we need to eliminate the tracking and sorting practices that have become so common advantaging some while disadvantaging others we need a framework and system that allows multiple access points and affirms the diversity and backgrounds of the students we serve we are committed to providing an education free from racism and bias and students seeing themselves reflected in the curricula is an important part of this we need our students to be taught through rich engaging problems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections we need more pathways so more students can learn algebra and take higherlevel math coursework we need a mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice so they will be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve we need to replace outdated tracking methods that segregates students into lowlevel remedial classes  opening acceleration and enrichment opportunities to more students

-1	please apply your sociology efforts in your history sociology and english classes not in your stem classes we need competent capable persons in our math and science fields unlike some other fields theres only one correct answer to math algebraic geometric etc questions regardless of what color you are our california kids are already woefully behind chinese students and are unprepared to do quality stem work in college please dont dissapate your efforts teaching stem courses by rying to correct other perceived ills or problems thank you judge brian r van camp ret superior court sacramento  
-1	the quality of public education in terms of mathematics has dropped to historical low maybe related to the pandemic it is time to establish a rigorous curriculum with quality control the new framework is not placing enough emphasis on that and it will likely further deteriorate the already bad situation in californias public schools  
1	thank you for considering my comment stating my support of the proposed mathematics framework as the associate superintendent for the campbell union school district i see the need for urgent change in math teaching and learning students are increasingly less engaged in math performance is steadily declining in our state and students lack access to high quality instruction the problem is far greater for marginalized students leading to a significant and ongoing lack of diversity in math related fields the framework supports teaching through the use of rich and engaging tasks that offer real world experiences it creates more opportunity for applied mathematics that will help shape our future career fields through the recommendation of various pathways for success finally it is essential that we abolish tracking that allows some students to access higher math skills while others are placed in subpar programs please approve this framework so that educators can do the work that we know will lead to better outcomes for californias students the time for positive change is now   
-1	the proposed california 2023 mathematics framework camf is just more racism and bigotry the entire framework stinks of antiasian racism at its worst merit not racism should be the california standard sadly camf is rooted in racism and should be immediately discarded   
-1	math test scores for us 13yearolds in 2023 have dropped to a new historic low in california in 2022 only 33 of students in grades 38 and 11 achieved math proficiency this is a direct result of focusing math education on political propaganda rather than mathematics the proposed math framework is openly antimerit it explicitly lowers standards to achieve equal outcomes and stresses political issues unrelated to the subject of mathematics equal outcomes only exist in a cemetery and not in a classroom of living breathing students people that work hard get the results people that refuse to work hard do not this is the american way if you want your bridges to stand your airplanes to fly and your doctors to cure you you should unapologetically reject all this equity nonsense

1	subject support the adoption for the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools dear state board i am writing to express my wholehearted support for the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools as an advocate for quality and equity in education and a firm believer in the importance of mathematics in shaping the future of our students i am thrilled to see the efforts being made to enhance the mathematics curriculum the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework is a significant step towards providing our students with a comprehensive and coherent curriculum by emphasizing the development of mathematical proficiency problemsolving skills and conceptual understanding the framework ensures that our students are equipped with the necessary tools to succeed in the 21st century i am particularly pleased to see the integration of technology and realworld applications in the revised framework bringing relevance to students in todays digital age is crucial so that our students are not only proficient in mathematical concepts but also capable of applying them in practical situations furthermore it will support our students to have a world size heart and a world class mind it will open up opportunities for collaboration and exchange of ideas with educators from around the world it also provides a clear roadmap for educators to follow facilitating consistency and coherence in mathematics instruction across different schools and districts i am also pleased that it includes guidance on approaches to teaching and learning assessment methods and professional development for teachers by providing teachers with the necessary support and resources the framework ensures that they are equipped to deliver highquality mathematics instruction this in turn will have a positive impact on student outcomes and overall educational attainment in conclusion i wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework for california public schools and commend the efforts being made to enhance mathematics education i believe that this will have a profound and lasting impact on our all students through equity equipping them with the skills and knowledge they need to excel in mathematics and beyond thank you for your dedication to providing equal opportunity for all students to learn i trust that you will consider my support for the adoption of the 2023 mathematics framework and take it into account as you continue to shape the future of mathematics education in our state yours sincerely nancy qushair  
-1	a group of palo alto parents has sued and won against pausds practices of holding back students and forcing them to repeat classes they have successfully completed in violation of edc 512245 512247 and 512282 the final court order on the case cohen v pausd 21cv385694 is pending but expected to be completed soon similarly a group of san francisco parents has sued sfusd on similar grounds for similar practices flentje v sfusd cpf23517987 violating these ed codes is an unavoidable consequence of forcing a wide span of abilities of 5 years into the same classroom especially as students take ucaccredited outside education in order to avoid being held back in math the cmf must not suggest practices that encourage districts to break the law in order to implement detracking at a minimum the cmf should warn districts not to break the law when implementing its recommendations this is a very real issue  
-1	math is factual and has zero to do with equity engagement stop polluting our childrens minds to think something is always wrong teach numbers not opinions  
1	as a veteran educator who has taught middle school through college level mathematics i see this framework as a way forward to making mathematics something valuable to students rather than a hoop to jump through this framework encourages students to see the point of math classes to know the value of mathematics in their world and to find joy in their pursuit of mathematics what we currently know is that the status quo has failed us with mathematics education lets do something that will change that and well see a positive impact that extends to all students  
1	i am writing to ask that the board approve the new mathematics framework i am retired california elementary school teacher i taught 31 years and received my masters in teaching elementary mathematics i was chosen to help review mathematic curriculum the last time we were here equity in mathematics education is necessary in the california of today thank you for your time geri cook  
1	as an educator we need to make significant shifts in our instructional practices the new framework addresses and focuses on those shifts please adopt  
1	this math teacher loves the new framework please make it happen __  
1	its time to make the moves our children deserve with approving the mathematics framework the committee put students first and we are waiting for the state board to follow  
-1	this version has done nothing to address the serious concerns raised by dr brian conrad it contains the same misrepresentation of citations which he points out here   see attached for an example this framework will hurt the underserved communities and shut them out of stem careers it would be complete malpractice to pass this  
1	the framework needs to be in place and support kids in schools conceptual math is a must for kids to understand its relationship to the real world the framework should not be a political statement its about kids and our future   
-1	chapter 2 teaching for equity and engagement is about as nonmath as possible encourage equitable outcomes teaching toward social justice the government education system has failed miserably at teaching actual math so its deciding to teach other topics in math class this is despicable and actual math must only be taught in class equity has nothing to do with educating any person on how to perform math equations no one person is better at math due to their sex gender religion etc stick to numerical formulas that are proven science based equations and all persons will be given equal treatment from their respective teachers teachers  staff making up instructional material instead of proven factual mathematical data are the problem and need to be dealt with accordingly if they are implementing nonrelated or biased material aka fired i oppose all material dealing with dei or crt as they have no business in mathematics  
1	i am supportive of replacing outdated tracking methods which select kids for math opportunity before they have all fully matured this has cut out a raft of kids who would love math under these new proposals  please change this unfair system asap  
-1	i write in objection to the proposed guidelines teaching social justice in the teaching of math dilutes and confuses the concept of social justice and how it can be appropriately contextualized and understood math can be hard enough to learn adding a totally unrelated layer will confuse and dilute the standalone value and importance of mathematical concepts
