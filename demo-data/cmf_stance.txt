1	"Dear Members of the State Board of Education, As the director of Calculus Roundtable, I am pleased to express our strong support for the adoption of the California math framework. This framework is crucial to promoting equitable access to rigorous math coursework for all California children, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. It is particularly important to highlight the need for cultural relevancy in delivering math instruction, especially in districts with a minority majority student population. By incorporating cultural relevancy into the curriculum, students are able to see themselves in the coursework and find solutions to problems that are relevant to their own experiences. in turn this to higher engagement and greater academic success for all students. Research has shown that students who are provided with culturally relevant instruction perform better academically and feel more engaged in their education. This is especially true for students from underrepresented communities, who often feel disconnected from the traditional curriculum. By embracing cultural relevancy in math instruction, we can work to ensure that all students have the opportunity to express their own brilliance and reach their full potential. We urge the State Board of Education to adopt the California math framework and continue to prioritize equity and cultural relevancy in education. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Jim Hollis Director, Calculus Roundtable "

Math isn't just used for coding,) or if we want our citizens to be financially literate, we need high quality math instruction in our K-12 schools. And no, I don't believe Jo Bowler's theories qualify as such. Kids who are interested in math and want to push themselves should not be held back to serve adults' political biases or enrich consultants. I find the education bureaucracy's ideas about children's abilities condescending and offensive. SF's math experiment is largely a failure. I know this because I live there and am a parent. The public school system that worked well for my husband and me has been so thoroughly dismantled and redirected from its core mission of education that it was not a viable option for our children. It is a tragedy that should not be compounded.  "

-1	"RE: July 12-13, 2023 Agenda Item No. 17, Mayacamas Charter Middle School Dear President Darling-Hammond and Board Members: On behalf of The Napa Foundation for Options in Education, operator of the Mayacamas Charter Middle School, I write to request the removal of Item 17 from the State Board's July 12-13 agenda to "Set Aside the State Board of Education's September 15, 2022 Reversal of the Denials of the Mayacamas Charter Middle School Petition to Comply with a Writ of Mandate To Be Issued in Napa Valley Unified School District v. California State Board of Education and California School Boards Association's Education Legal Alliance v. California State Board of EducationÉ." Respectfully, the item is premature and legally improper for at least three reasons. First, under the Bagley-Keene Opening Meeting Act, this late-added item cannot be placed on the agenda without a vote of two-thirds of the members of the State Board on the basis that there is a need to take "immediate action." (Government Code Section 1125.3.) There is no item on the agenda to approve the addition of this new item after the expiration of the deadline to post the agenda, nor a need to take "immediate action," and therefore, the State Board cannot consider and act on the item as agendized. Second, as of the transmission time of this letter, the Court has not actually issued any judgment, and irrespective of whether the timing of its issuance may be measured in days or weeks, the Court has not actually compelled the State Board to take any action. In fact, the Court today rejected the NVUSD's proposed form of judgment for technical reasons, so there isn't even a form of judgment pending before the Court. What is important here is that the Court's decision is not final until the judgment is entered and a writ issues. It would be premature for the State Board to take action in response to a judgment that has not actually been entered or a writ that has not issued, and accordingly, CDE staff's recommendation to take action in "anticipation" of a judgment is inappropriate. Even if a judgment were entered after you receive this letter but before Thursday morning (which is highly unlikely in that the form was today rejected), the State Board is not bound to satisfy the judgment's directives if the State Board and/or Napa Foundation appeal the judgment. The judgment and writ of mandate directed to the State Board are automatically "stayed", or held in abeyance, upon the filing of a notice of appeal. (Code of Civil Procedure Section 916.) When the State Board meets in closed session this week, we request the State Board to authorize the filing of an appeal, particularly given what is at stake for the State Board, i.e., to protect the authority vested in the State Board by law to do what is right and necessary for California students when misguided local decisions fail to protect their interests. In any event, the Napa Foundation intends to appeal the judgments at its earliest opportunity. Given that at least Napa Foundation will be filing an appeal, the State Board should expect that any judgment will be stayed, and should therefore not attempt to set aside the September 15, 2022 action unless and until an appeal is resolved against the State Board. Third, even if there is no appeal, the State Board is under no legal obligation to set aside Mayacamas' charter at this juncture without reconsideration. To the contrary, if the State Board sets aside its September 15, 2022 decision, the State Board is obligated to reconsider approving Mayacamas' charter petition and may approve it again with a more detailed, or even different rationale. Significantly, the Court did not in any way invalidate the State Board's initial and threshold decision to hear Napa Foundation's appeal under Section 47605(k)(2), which stands unaffected by the Court's ruling. That decision was based on CDE's recommendation to hear the appeal in light of factual disputes in the documentary record that were appropriate for the State Board to evaluate. Section 47605(k)(2) provides that "[i]f the state board hears the appeal, the state board may affirm the determination of the governing board of the school district or the county board of education, or both of those determinations, or may reverse only upon a determination that there was an abuse of discretion." Thus, the State Board may still choose to reverse the denial of the charter, again, following a hearing of the appeal and considering the Court's rulings in the lawsuits. But in any event, it must eventually hear the appeal, consistent with the State Board's vote on September 15, 2022 to do so. The Court's ruling was clear in that regard: "[t]he Court will not opine what further steps the State Board must take, if any, or how the State Board should exercise its discretionÉ A peremptory writ shall issue commanding Respondent to take action specially enjoined by law in accordance with the Court's ruling, but nothing in the writ shall limit or control in any way the discretion legally vested in Respondent." This invites the State Board to issue new and/or revised findings for approval that account for the Court's articulation of the appropriate standards for the State Board to apply. It invites the State Board to address, more specifically, the abuses of discretion below, e.g., through written findings that explain the State Board's rationale for approving the charter in sufficient detail to satisfy the Court's issues with the original approval. These abuses of discretion were laid out in detail in Napa Foundation's appeal to the State Board. * * * Napa Foundation and its hundreds of parent, student, and teacher supporters are grateful for the State Board's September 15, 2022 decision approving the charter, a decision the State Board made in the best interests of California schoolchildren, in recognition of the highly flawed denials below by the Napa Valley Unified School District and Napa County Board of Education. The State Board got it exactly right when it observed that the supposed fiscal rationales for the denials were not actually evidence that Mayacamas would "substantially undermine" existing District services, sufficient for a lawful denial under Education Code Section 47605(c)(7), and that the District's denial was contrived for reasons inconsistent with the intent and standards for approval under the Charter Schools Act. Indeed, the District's own fiscal reports and analysis in December 2022, after the State Board approved Mayacamas, in no way supported a notion that Mayacamas would "substantially undermine" existing District services, and the District made no such argument in the litigation. The Court's rulings do not detract from the fundamental justification for the State Board's decision to approve the charter. We appreciate the State Board's vigorous defense of its decision in the litigation that ensued. The ruling in this case was, unfortunately, flawed, and failed to respect the State Board's authority and expertise in evaluating and correcting abuses of discretion in the charter authorizing process. Again, the agendized item is legally flawed and should be removed from the agenda in deference to the legal processes that remain pending, and the due process rights of the Napa Foundation.

Dear President Darling-Hammond: As a parent in the San Francisco Unified School District, and elected representative of the families in our city, I want to express my concern about how the adoption of our state's new mathematics framework could be interpreted by local school districts. I appreciate the work our State Board and Instructional Quality Commission have done over the past two years to strike a balance between a traditional and integrated approach, as well as a student need-based versus systemic approach. As an elected leader, I would not want to see a model, as was adopted in San Francisco, be promoted at the state level. Removing student and parent choice, to pursue an accelerated mathematics pathway, is in conflict with California's values and leadership in the international STEM industry. I appreciate that the State Board's framework does not promote this removal of choice but supports high quality and next-generation approaches to mathematics for our state's students. I understand the local control context of curriculum and textbook selection. However, I ask the State Board to consider how the state can better support local education leaders in this foundational decision. Sincerely, Philip Y. Ting Assemblymember, 19th District" 
-1	" Math Content Standards are being replaced by 'big ideas' not written by mathematicians Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with "Big Ideas" aligned to 4 "Content Connections" which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the "big ideas" will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students (especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards ill-defined and vague "big ideas" which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered. A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: "This framework serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013." (Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly FAILED to do its job. In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you to reject recommends teaching "Big Ideas" as the content (see evidence below). Who decided the "big ideas" should replace the content standards (which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD's in MATHEMATICS and which were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)? According to the CMF, three individuals determined the "big ideas" for California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468 we read, "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following." Who are "Boaler, Munson and Williams" who apparently have the authority to determine what students in California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics). NONE of the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where "big ideas" created by non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce; the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers. Additionally, the CMF tells us these "big ideas" (chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of big ideas. "It should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation. Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas." (Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in California. Why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students' fate or allowing grade level teams (who typically involve teachers without math degrees) to decide what "big ideas" their students will learn. This will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation. Furthermore, in reading the CMF it is noted that the "big ideas" originated during distance learning. "So a focused set of big ideas, indicated as Big Ideas, was created as part of the California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance initiative (CDE, 2021). These grade level Big Ideas, organized by Content Connections, and inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards, are presented in the grade-banded chapters, 6, 7, and 8." (Ch 13 line 545). Note the use of the phrase "inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards"; why not ALL content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers? Evidence that the CMF wants to REPLACE Math Content Standards with their "Big Ideas" _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 6 line 228) _ "The foundational mathematics contentÑthat is, the big ideas' (Ch 6 line 942) _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 7 line 165) _ Teachers should be "Teaching from big ideas, not individual standards." (Ch 10 line 177) _ "Educators of pre-service teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authentic-context, big-idea-based instruction described in this framework." (Ch 10, line 247). So the "big ideas" proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past! This replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design, publishers, Teacher Preparation Programs, and grading as well. _ "This framework reflects a revised approach, advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas." (Ch 1 Line 405) _ "To help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep, active learning of mathematics for all students, this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs." (Ch 1 Line 50) _ "Planning teaching around big ideas, the first component of equitable, engaging teaching, lays the groundwork for enacting the other four." (Ch 1 line 361) _ "Design class activities around big ideas, with an emphasis on investigations and connections, not individual standards.' (Ch 1 line 590) _ "In the classroom, teachers teach the big ideas by designing instruction around student investigations of intriguing, authentic experiences relevant to students' grade level, backgrounds, and interests." (Ch 6 line 235) _ "These include designing lessons from a small number of big ideas in each grade band; spending a preponderance of student time on authentic problems that engage multiple content and practice standards situated within one or more big ideas; focusing on connections, to students' lives and among mathematical ideas; and using strategies that show connections between different mathematical ideas on various topics across grade levels." (Ch 10 line 789) _ "Instructional materials should primarily involve tasks that invite students to make sense of these big ideas, elicit wondering in authentic contexts, and necessitate mathematical 2 investigation. Big ideas in math are central to the learning of mathematics, link numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole, and provide focal points for students' investigations. An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. For example, environmental observations and issues on campus and in students' local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis. Such discussions will concurrently help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 8 line 147) _ "Mastery-based grading describes a form of grading that focuses on mastery of ideas rather than on points or scores. This approach is sometimes referred to as standards-based grading, and although it refers to standards, it does not have to focus on specific standards. It could, instead, use cluster headings, which are more akin to the Content Connections and Big Ideas approach of this framework." Ch 12 line 606 Note that not EVEN ONCE are the Math Content Standards Written out anywhere in the over 17,000 lines of text. How can the SBE adopt a CA math framework that does not even list the content standards students are supposed to learn? The math content standards were written in a logical order. As the CMF accurately notes, "California's mathematics content standards were built on progressions of topics across grade levels, informed by both research on children's cognitive development and by the logical structure of mathematics." (Ch 6 line 982). Later on we read, "The Common Core State Standards are based on an understanding of how young people typically develop mathematical knowledge and skills in a sequenced." (Ch 3 line 41) So why would the SBE adopt a CA math framework that recommends we shift away from this logical structure that is sequenced and built on research towards a single interpretation of "big ideas"? As Chapter 5 line 507 states, "As readers consider the three subsequent chapters of the framework, they will see ideas similar to the ones discussed in this chapter, organized to help them learn about and begin to use the big ideas approach. While the transition between standards domains and progressions discussed in this chapter and this new approach will not be straightforward for classroom teachers, both emphasize the central idea that students at all levels should have experiences that build their mathematical toolkits for making sense of their worlds." So the CMF is clearly suggesting a "transition" from standards domains and progression (those research based, logical, sequenced standards) to a "new" approach (big ideas) that will not be straightforward. This is not an experiment I want performed on CA public school students. We also read in Chapter 1 line 369, "To reach the goal of deep, active learning of mathematics for all, this framework encourages a shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction (see box). It instead encourages teachers to think about TKÐ12 math as a series of big ideas." What evidence is there to make these major shifts? In Chapter 2, line 287 the CMF states, "Rather than focusing on specific procedures and memorization, instruction is more effective when teachers aim to develop understanding of bigger ideas and procedures." What study do they cite to support this claim? NONE. The CMF is now making changes to instruction away from the standards based instruction California has implemented for over 26 years without ANY EVIDENCE. There are a number of major concerns (beyond the background of who wrote the big ideas and the lack of evidence they will help students become proficient in math, and the fact that one interpretation of this will replace standards based instruction. 1. The CA Common Core Standards for Math were written such that some standards were designated as "Major" and others were designated as "additional" or "supporting". It is 3 explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations) ,an, ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The CMF proposes that teachers "organize early-grade instruction around the Content Connections, which connect the mathematical big ideas." (Ch 6 line 153).The 4 Content Connections, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? How will it help students achieve proficiency in math and be competitive for STEM careers? As noted previously, the CMF proposed a "shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction." On what evidence and research is this proposed? The authors of the CA Math Content standards (which this CMF proposed replacing with big ideas) surely had and used evidence as they wrote standards and noted which were major. 2. Based upon what is written in the CMF (and the fact that the math content standards are NEVER listed or written out anywhere in the 14 chapters + 3 appendices), there is no reason to believe teachers will even address most of the content standards if they implement this CMF. _ The language of the CMF reveals not all standards will be addressed and further shows a lack of knowledge of the standards by the authors of the CMF. i. The CMF makes statements about instances when teachers might touch "multiple standards". "These chapters illustrate this framework's approach to instructional design by focusing on several big ideas that have great impact on students' conceptual understanding of numbers and that also encompass multiple content standards." (Ch 1 line 1699) Again in Chapter 8, line 922 we read, "As students explore and investigate with the Big Ideas, they will likely encounter many different content standards." ii. In another example, Chapter 3 line 812, we read about what teaching big ideas looks like in a classroom. The CMF states, "Students need time and opportunity to collaborate, critique, and reason about where to place the numbers on the number line (SMP.2, 3). For example, where might 4/7 be placed in relation to 1Ú2." This is great, but the problem is that this is describing a grade 5 classroom and the standards come from grade 4. Again, this gives the public no confidence that the authors of the CMF even know the content standards; further, this does not give the public confidence that our students, if the CMF is adopted, will have a chance to learn them. iii. In another example we read, "In sixth grade, students are introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers." (Ch 3 line 1302). Students are actually introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers in 4 BOTH the grades 3 & 4 content standards. Again I ask, do the authors of the CMF know the content standards? iv. In yet another example, the CMF states, "For example, content standard 4.NF.2 (compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators) may be addressed during an investigation in which students reason with data (CC1) and the same standard might also be addressed by lessons in which students take wholes apart and/or put parts together (CC3)." (Ch 6 line 301/431) This does not sound logical and well thought out but relies on when teachers "might" do math; given CA students' dire performance in math, we can not adopt a framework that has opportunities to possibly learn specific math. _ There are CONTENT STANDARDS MISSING from the "big idea" tables. While the CMF never tries to write out all the math content standards, it does attempt to at least list a standard number next to each big idea. However, in doing this, they SKIPPED 3 standards. The revision process of this third version of the CMF has lasted over a year and not one author can notice that 3 standards are missing? That is unacceptable! i. TK is missing NS 2.4: Solve simple addition and subtraction problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting. ii. Grade 2 is missing NBT 4: Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. iii. Grade 6 is missing EE 8: Write an inequality of the form x>c or x>c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x>c or x<c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams. iv. When a standard is written out, it is partially written out which is very misleading to an elementary teacher who has multiple subjects to teach and cannot be expected to memorize all the math standards. For example grade 3 notes the standard "Categorize shapes by attributes and recognize that different shapes may share certain attributes." (3.G.1) Unfortunately they left out the specific shape names listed in the actual standard (which include rhombus, parallelogram square and rectangle) so a grade 3 teacher reading the framework is likely to work on all shapes as opposed to the specific and narrow focus on quadrilaterals as called out in the content standards. _ Apparently to defend choosing not to write out the math content standards, the CMF argues "Given educators' more-advanced understanding of the individual standards, this framework focuses on connections between standards" (Ch 1 line 809) What about new teachers or those who switch grade levels? They surely don't know the standards. The CMF is happy to list the standards for 5 mathematical practice MULTIPLE times (e.g, Ch 4 line 378), so why can't we adopt a CMF that at least lists the math CONTENT standards once? 3. Examples of how to teach the "big ideas" through "content connections" reveal a clear lack of math knowledge of the writers of the CMF and give the public reason for concern if this CMF is implemented. Following are some specific examples of bizarre and illogical associations. _ Grade 2: "Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them." is listed under the big idea "Represent Data" How is cutting a rectangle "data"? _ Grade 2 MD 5 "Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem." This standard is listed under the big idea "Dollars and cents" How is "length" listed under dollars and cents? _ Grade 4: NBT 3 "Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place," and NBT 4 "Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm." These are both listed under the big idea of "Shapes and Symmetry", defined as "Draw and identify shapes, looking at the relationships between rays, lines, and angles. Explore symmetry through folding activities." _ Grade 5: "NF 4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. a. Interpret the product (a/b) _ q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of operations a _ q Ö b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) _ 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do the same with (2/3) _ (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) _ (c/d) = ac/bd.) b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas. 5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by: a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication. b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given number (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b = (n _ a)/(n _ b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1. 7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) Ö 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) Ö 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) _ 4 = 1/3. b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for 4 Ö (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 Ö (1/5) = 20 because 20 _ (1/5) = 4. c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to 6 represent the problem." Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! _ Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 4. An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, 7 students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? 5. The authors of the CMF clearly see their "big ideas" as rivals of the math content standards. _ We read, "Chapters 6, 7, and 8 set out an approach to mathematics teaching through big ideas that integrates mathematical content and practices instead of narrow procedures." (Ch 12 line 92). Why are the math content standards (which were written to reflect a BALANCE of conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency and application) now being called "narrow procedures"? _ In a sample rubric to help assess students, we read, "Student Strength: What does the student understand in terms of this standard? What linguistic and cultural assets possessed by the students can I tap into to support all students, including those on the road to English proficiency, in their mastery of the content? Student Area for Growth: What should the student focus on to strengthen their understanding of this standard? (Ch 12 line 112) This sounds like we're back to standards based assessment; the only problem is there are NO content standards listed; just "big ideas". The CMF is conflating their "big ideas" with "content standards" Textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed. _ To be eligible for adoption, programs must include a well-defined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards (Ch 13 line 239) _ Materials that fail to meet all of the criteria in category 1 (Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards) will not be considered suitable for adoption. (Ch 13 line 246) _ Instructional materials, as defined in EC Section 60010(h), must be aligned to the CA CCSSM Content Standards and SMPs, adopted by the SBE in August 2010 and modified in January 2013. (Ch 13 line 257) SBE, please hold the CMF to the SAME standard that the state of CA holds publisher to and require the CMF to address and list all math content standards. Do not allow three individuals of which 1 holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and none hold masters or doctoral degrees in mathematics to determine what students will learn in CA public schools. The 2013 CA Common Core Content Standards for math were well written, written by experts with authority and written based upon research about how children learn math. The 2013 CA Math framework did an exceptional job describing what those standards look like and what it means for students to master those. Please REJECT this CMF and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which has much greater promise of helping all students achieve in California."

Even if its adoption ended up successfully elevating students' *average* math achievement--which is not borne by the poorly documented and incorrectly analyzed evidence presented--its detrimental effect on the highest achievers will have far more damaging consequences for California and for the U.S. The highest achieving students are, almost universally, the wellspring of the technological and entrepreneurial innovation that fuels our economy and our progress as a species. Holding back those students would be ethically and morally bankrupt, and disastrously counterproductive for California's future. Furthermore, any drive for homogeneity in education should be to elevate standards, not lower them. If the societal objective is to increase the diversity of students entering STEM careers, then handicapping California's students relative to the rest of the country and the world is exactly the opposite of what should be done to achieve that objective. Clearly, this initiative to reduce mathematics educational standards to the lowest common denominator is not what it purports to be. The pursuit of scientific integrity, the advancement of California's and American competitive advancement in technology and the economy, and the advancement of STEM DEI goals are all being irreparably harmed by this ill-conceived experiment. The deleterious outcomes from adopting this Framework are clearly evident at any level of scrutiny.

-1	"Lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected."

1	"Please see the attached support letter from The Knowledge Shop California has an opportunity to dramatically change the way it teaches math. Mathematics instruction in California can be more effective and equitable. In many CA districts, current teaching practices have resulted in only one-third of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures across the state. Additionally, most students are being pushed out of high-level pathways at a young age. Lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with outdated methods, using narrow, procedural questions. This has had real consequences. Today, less than half of California students satisfy A-G requirements, thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and careers. California has insufficient educators qualified to work in STEM. It has to hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year. Math education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success, preventing first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latine students, students with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to 4-year colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers. These programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which use standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude Black students from gifted classrooms and relegate English Learner students into low-level educational pathways at an early age. These tests, often given in elementary school, have been used to sort and label students as those who are ""good at math"" and those who are not, and often determine who and who are not ""college material."" The revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics. _ Students will be taught through rich, engaging problems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections. _ Pathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take higher-level math coursework. _ A mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice. Students will be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve. _ Replacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into low-level remedial classes - with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more students. 1 www.theknowledgeshopla.com (323) 903-6486 2723 W. 54th Street Los Angeles, California 90043 Schools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years, based on extensive scientific evidence, and have shown higher and more equitable outcomes. Because of the framework's focus on opening pathways for students who have traditionally been excluded from higher-level math instruction, it has been the target of a well-funded misinformation campaign. For example, organizations like the Independent Institute, a dark-money Koch donor network-funded organization, cite complaints that align with other right-wing attacks on educational justice. This right-wing think tank report makes unfounded claims, deriding the framework for focusing on ""environmental and social justice,"" ""trauma-informed pedagogy,"" and ""contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics."" Right-wing pundits have perpetuated harmful narratives blaming racial and socioeconomic disparities in gifted and talented math instruction and poor math performance on students' aptitude, motivation, and God-given math ability. These detractors argue for ineffective and outdated math practices and offer no solutions. They promote parental fear by using dog whistles that equate innovative and equitable approaches to effective mathematics instruction with ""dumbing down"" the curriculum. They repeat false talking points stating the CA Mathematics Framework mandates removing algebra from middle school instruction. These statements are both inaccurate and untrue. Decades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for math instruction. Methods that are creative, inclusive, culturally responsive, challenging, and affirming for all students and that engage students more effectively. Strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace. The revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and five writers and has gone through a two-year process of public comments and revisions. As of April 2023, over 66 organizations and 2,800 educators, researchers, and parents signed a letter of support for the California Math Framework. 2 www.theknowledgeshopla.com (323) 903-6486 2723 W. 54th Street Los Angeles, California 90043 They include: _ The California County Offices of Education _ The California Mathematics Council _ The National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) _ The National Council for Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM) _ Just Equations _ TODOS Ð Organization for Excellence and Equity in Mathematics _ Education Trust-West _ Center for Equity for English Learners at Loyola Marymount University _ California Partnership for Math and Science Education Don't let outsiders' money and political agendas determine the future of California and its children! Right-wing interests are investing millions of dollars to dismantle progress made by parents and educators working hard to make CA public schools more effective and equitable for all students and especially those who have historically been excluded in high-level math instruction. We see a similar backlash in the ever-increasing attacks on inclusive education in other content areas such as teaching true history, banning diverse books, and targeting LGBTQ-inclusive practices. These detractors offer no solutions and instead argue we should go back to an education system that has a demonstrated track record of failure for a majority of our students. On July 12-13th, the CA School Board will be taking up a long-awaited decision to adopt a revised math framework.

-1	"I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54) The majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students, regardless of their skin color; in mathematics, this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards. What does the CMF suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups? Does the CMF devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students? Unfortunately, the CMF is instead focused on ensuring these students have "authentic experiences" and that teachers "center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics." (Ch 2 line 513) This is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer; who thinks that will help? Everyone knows you get better at soccer (and in our case, math) by learning and practicing. Rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of "show" to help them learn, let's support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the CAASPP.

1	"Esteemed Board Members, As a long time educator, I am so pleased the California is looking forward to the future of our state by developing our future mathematicians. The proposed framework empowers students to see math as relevant to their daily lives and useful in solving problems. With the rise of AI, our students need to see the application of math and develop the critical thinking skills to support themselves in their future careers. All students need to see themselves as capable learners. The interconnectedness of the Big Ideas in conjunction with the Drivers of Investigation, Content Connections, and Math Practices will create deeper, richer math learning for our students. I look forward to developing lessons and math units that utilize multiple standards and are connected to my student's lives and interests. It really opens up opportunities for students to see the connections of math and science, computer science, engineering, and social studies. The focus on equity and all student's ability to learn is crucial for us to see success across all demographic subgroups. All students need to receive the appropriate supports and the framework lays out some great strategies to allow our high students to soar and our low students to find success in math. So many students get turned off by math because they feel like they are always failing. The new framework helps develop students mathematical mindsets and provides opportunities for success via the multidimensional nature of mathematics. I wholeheartedly support the framework and what it will do for our students. Please adopt it. Thank you, Lora Carey Educator in Title 1 Schools and Districts for 10 years. " 
-1	"Following up on my prior comment, the attached .pdf document shows what was problematic about many of the citations in the SFR of the CMF. I haven't had time to scour the citations in the 2023 draft, but I see that many of these issues are still outstanding. Other commenters have already pointed to some of them. There is no room for any such misrepresentation in a document that will guide the mathematics education for all the public schools in our nation's most populous state. The fact that these false and misleading citations are driving state-issued guidelines is unacceptable, and the framework needs to be rejected. Furthermore, the framework's recommendation pertaining to a Data Science high school course option are based on the course qualifying for Area C of the University of California's A-G requirements, a status that the UC BOARS Committee is meeting today to consider revoking. In light of the fact that this revocation is potentially imminent, it is foolish to adopt a flawed standard that won't even pass muster with the University of California and the California State University systems. These courses have already been rejected as fulfilling the math requirements for CSU schools. It would be incredibly shortsighted to adopt a framework containing curricular recommendations that its own state college system has rejected. Supporters of the framework are hearing the good intentions and exercising their faith in the good will of the authors, but they seem to be oblivious to these many issues, issues which, as a matter of procedure should have stopped this framework dead in its tracks long ago. Additional issues, which I am echoing from other commenters: - The CMF asserts with scant evidence that the solution the failings of California's public schools is to adopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional approaches. There is a large body of research and experience that indicates other approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve mathematics instruction. - The lead writer of the CMF writing team had a conflict of interest because, much of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims, particularly with regard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come from the organization she runs -- YouCubed.org. This author earns substantial income consulting with CA public school districts advising on mathematics curricular changes, and there is a fair likelihood that the state will approve textbooks that she's authored -- a prohibited conflict of interest. - If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by California school districts, it is my informed opinion that California K-12 students' achievements in mathematics will continue to decline. The first chapter of the CMF says it is 'centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs.' This focus on big ideas, connection to 'authentic' student contexts, and vague notions of 'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily reduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills. " 
-1	"The insertion of equity discussion does not belong in Math class. "The CFCC shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the grade-level chapters to support universal access and ensure access, equity, and inclusion for all students.' NAEP math scores have plunged in CA. CA fails to include discussion of bringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the NAEP proves. There is NO provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math class as a discussion class on equity. UDL contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or math competency. NAEP scores lowest in a decade. Where is the math proficiency component in the math framework? CA needs research based strategies for achievement, especially if minority groups are struggling with mathematics. Why are the Asian students performing at higher levels? Research has shown that equitable strategies do not work. CA needs to look at other state models where student achievement in Math are much higher.  "

There is still much work to be done on clarifying the pathways in high school mathematics to ensure that students have access to essential mathematics that prepares them for success in college or careers in ways that align with their goals and aspirations. I support the current version as a starting point for these important ongoing discussions of how to improve mathematics outcomes for all students. And encourage SBE to set up a task force or committee to develop a thoughtful, strategic, and empirical plan to improve high school math pathways. The revised version of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Schools is an improvement from previous versions. I feel that section in pages 2 - 8 of Appendix A is redundant and in some cases misaligned with the content presented in Chapter 8. I do not think it helps clarify or serve a useful purpose. I propose eliminating those pages, and use the section "Key Mathematical Ideas to Promote Student Success in Introductory University Courses in Quantitative Fields" as the entirety of the Appendix.

I apologize for any extra work this may cause your staff. Thank you for the positive work you do on behalf of the children and families of California. Sincerely, Rebecca Walker Dear California State Board of Education Members, In 2022 the Lake County Office of Education (LCOE), in partnership with the Butte County Office of Education (BCOE), the Chico Math Project, and the North Coast Math Project, wrote a Learning Acceleration System Grant proposal to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE). This grant was approved and now funds a little more than eleven million dollars over a five year period to support mathematics education to 22 rural counties in California. Our group, the Rural Math Collaborative (RMC), has been engaged in providing a high-level of professional learning to our rural county offices of education, school districts, and teaching teams since May 2022. As a collaborative, we wanted to voice our support for the adoption of the California Mathematics Framework (item 11) on the July 12th agenda. Our work as the RMC is focused on the outstanding instructional strategies and supports outlined in the CA Mathematics Framework, namely lesson study, high-impact coaching, math intervention, and teacher professional learnin on this framework in particular. We are excited to see this on the agenda and look forward to its approval so that we may begin to engage our teams in a robust rollout of its contents. Thank you for the work you do to support our schools and educators. Please vote to approve the California Mathematics Framework on July 12. Sincerely," 
-1	"My experiences are those as a mother, 8 years reading UC Berkeley freshman applications, and 15 years advising college applicants. My educational background is Stanford Human Biology major, Johns Hopkins MA, and UC Berkeley MBA. Having had 2 sons in Stanford's EPGY (Educational Program for Gifted Youth) math program, I strongly disagree with the proposed California Math Framework (CMF). (I also have a son with a learning disability, so I understand that side of education.) The EPGY program was based on the best math programs from around the world. EPGY allowed a math-gifted son to wrap up most engineering-required math courses by the end of high school (HS). Why not adapt the EPGY pedagogy for the CMF? I am commenting because I believe that the proposed CMF is being determined by those who fear math. That a female, Ms. Boaler, supports a CMF that begins algebra I in 9th grade makes me wonder whether the premise is equity or a cultural convention of females fearing math. About a decade ago at a Stanford class reunion, a workshop showed female math SAT curves shifted to the left of similarly shaped male SAT curves. If Asian females are prepped by telling them that Asians do well in math, their SAT curves showed no difference from male curves. Perhaps the problem is finding good math teachers. Flipped classrooms may be the solution: Assign Khan Academy videos as homework and use math class periods as guided practice. I've heard of data science as an algebra 2 option, but that can reduce admission eligibility to other US colleges that don't recognize that equivalence. Algebra 2 is also a prerequisite for statistics courses required by today's majors, including social sciences. What my gifted sons did is typical of top students seen in UC Berkeley applications. Completing algebra I and geometry in middle school allows calculus before HS graduation, required for admission to Caltech, Harvey Mudd, and many business majors. The proposed CMF makes HS calculus impossible unless a student doubles up on math courses. The proposed CMF actually reduces equity in that well-informed students could find ways to get extra math courses. In short, all my experiences say that beginning algebra I in 9th grade retards development of math gifted students and destroys eligibility for meeting college math requirements. Going into the Brave New World of AI reminds me of how it was after Sputnik. The proposed CMF doesn't seem to recognize these realities and should be trashed. This reminds me of when my sons were to learn 'whole-word' reading instead of phonics. A generation of kids didn't learn to read. There is a fundamental math/science pathway but, instead of watered-down a-g math courses, an innovative math pedagogy would also support business and hands-on careers. The beauty of math can be seen in the traditional path. An alternative path could show that figures don't lie, but liars figure. Meanwhile, the rest of the world supplies immigrants who fill US tech jobs. " 
-1	"I appose item 11. Our children deserve better than to be dragged into a radical political agenda. We need to keep aspiring to excellence for them rather than dumbing down their subjects especially math. Makes no sense. For those that need extra help, there's provision. For those who are excelling, let's keep challenging them! " 
-1	It is awful 
-1	"I am opposing the 2023 Math Framework for California Public Schools because it is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math. Math is a hard subject that needs to be learned with rigor and a lot practices as well. The focus should be adopting the right teaching methods and providing positive feedback to the kids who really put in the efforts to learn. We could lower all the testing criteria to make everyone feeling good about an inflated evaluation of their math capability, but that will not change the fact they are still lacking in understanding the real math and cannot solve the real problems in life. This simply sets them up to face bigger frustrations and failures down the road. We should make students feel "positive" about math by teaching them proper math and enabling them to gain satisfaction from solving real challenging problems step by step. Often times I hear from Kids that they get bored and disengaged in the classrooms/school if they are not getting the right challenges in learning. "

-1	"I am opposing this 2023 Math Framework for California Public Schools because its lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors. We need more people to succeed in the STEM majors to push forward the innovations that have been propelling the technology advancement that contributed to a few most profound changes in the human history. Holding back students who are capable is detrimental to preparing our next generation to be able to take up the new challenges, and in the near term will reduce their chance to continue into good colleges in STEM majors or result in more likelihood for them to fail in college. Kids who are academically strong should be provided a good development path in public schools just like kids who are strong in sports or arts, otherwise this would cause the inequality opportunity issue for socio-economically disadvantaged kids in academics advancement.

1	"Date: July 7th, 2023 Subject: Public Comment in Support of California's Mathematics Framework Dear California Department of Education, I am writing to provide my support for the proposed Mathematics Framework for California. As an educator and advocate for quality mathematics education, I commend the Department for its dedication to developing a comprehensive framework that aligns with research-based practices and addresses the needs of all students. I would like to express my enthusiasm for the emphasis on mathematical thinking, problem-solving, and reasoning throughout the framework. These skills are crucial for students to develop a deep understanding of mathematics and apply their knowledge to real-world situations. By promoting these skills, the Mathematics Framework will empower students to become critical thinkers and lifelong learners. Chapter 5 stands out as a significant advancement in mathematics education, as it specifically addresses the importance of data science skills for students in the modern era. The progressions outlined in this chapter provide clear and age-appropriate learning pathways, enabling students to develop a strong foundation in data literacy and engage in meaningful applications of mathematics to real-world scenarios. I would also like to express my appreciation for the framework's effort to clarify various terms used throughout the document. The definitions and explanations provided for mathematical concepts and processes are thorough and beneficial for educators and students alike. However, I would like to recommend that the term ""data cleaning"" be included in the glossary or further elaborated within the framework. Clarifying this term will ensure a shared understanding among educators and students, as data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science process. While the framework effectively connected mathematics with computer science standards, I believe there is an opportunity to establish additional connections with other disciplines. Mathematics has inherent ties with science, technology, engineering, and the arts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary connections and providing guidance on integrating mathematics with these disciplines, the framework can foster a holistic and well-rounded education, showcasing the interconnectedness of mathematics with various fields of study. I appreciate the mention of specific tools that support data analysis and visualization in the framework. However, I would like to underscore the importance of incorporating commonly used programming languages into data science education. Proficiency in programming languages like Python and R has become increasingly vital in the field of data science. By prioritizing the inclusion of these programming languages in the framework, students will develop practical skills that align with industry demands, better preparing them for future careers and academic pursuits. I would like to emphasize the alignment between the skills presented in the Mathematics Framework for California and the data skills assessed in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP data from 2011 to 2022 reveals a decline in average scores and achievement levels in mathematics for California, with an average scale score change of -6 and a grade level loss of -0.5. By incorporating data science concepts and emphasizing data literacy in the mathematics curriculum, as outlined in the framework, California can address this decline and equip students with the necessary skills to succeed in mathematics and beyond. The inclusion of data analysis, interpretation, and problem-solving skills will empower students to navigate the increasingly data-driven world, supporting their academic and career readiness. In addition, I would like to highlight the growing recognition of the importance of data science education in other states across the country. For instance, Virginia has taken a significant step by creating and approving standalone data science standards, acknowledging the unique skill set required to navigate and analyze data effectively. Similarly, Utah is actively conducting a pilot program that includes standalone data science courses, accompanied by cohorts of professional development for teachers. These initiatives, along with the widespread adoption of the data science course code created by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the National School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), demonstrate the increasing nationwide recognition of the need to equip students with data science skills. Almost half of the country has either implemented the SCED data science course code or developed their own data science course codes. By incorporating data science concepts into the Mathematics Framework for California, the state can join these leading efforts and ensure that its students are prepared for the data-driven world they will encounter in their academic and professional lives. This alignment with national trends will enable California students to develop the necessary tools to thrive in the data-driven world, remain competitive in an evolving job market, and contribute to the innovation and growth of the state. Thank you for considering my testimony. I want to express my deep appreciation for the Mathematics Framework for California and emphasize how much I value it as an exceptional tool for teachers. The framework provides comprehensive guidance and innovative strategies that empower educators to deliver engaging instruction, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and data literacy skills among their students. By equipping teachers with the necessary resources and support, the framework ensures that students receive a high-quality mathematics education that prepares them for success in the 21st century. I firmly believe that the implementation of the Mathematics Framework will have a positive and transformative impact on mathematics education in California. Should you require any further information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I eagerly anticipate the implementation of the Mathematics Framework and the incredible benefits it will bring to both teachers and students in California.

-1	"This Framework has an Inadequate Focus on the Evaluation and Goal of Math Proficiency Math builds on itself so that without assuring mastery of each topic students are unprepared, thus PROFICIENCY must be the goal, not just "enhancing learning", or "positive mathematics identities". Standardized tests are most effective at evaluating proficiency.  To supplement these tests some measures allow for after the formal assessment on can "test limits", deviating from standard procedures gathering qualitative observations such as those described as "formative assessment". There is an entire chapter of over 60 pages on Assessment and no where is there a mention of modern test standards that are based on rigorous psychometric data including norms, reliability, and validity testing.  Specifically, no where is there any reference to the term test validity, the concept that assessments must have some evidence that they measure the underlying concept they purport to measure.  For example, one would expect a score on a test of Advanced Placement Calculus to predict whether students could solve Calculus problems in different college level tests or for their score on the test to be related to their grade in the class.  There is also no reference to reliability (e.g.scores are not random so that if students take a test twice, their scores should be roughly comparable as measured by a reliability coefficient [a correlation between scores across students]).   To have these essential features requires the use of standardized tests such as the CAASP and MDTP. There is a discussion of giving students feedback on their assessment which is laudable; however, to the extent that feedback is vague and unreliable rather than providing refined information on subskill mastery using measures that meet the rigorous psychometric standards of the National Center of Intensive Intervention (NCII), it is useless. NWEAMAP would give far more granular detail about subskill mastery. Refer to the www.thescienceofmath.com for further discussion. If a goal of the Framework is to increase math ability, there is no discussion of using evidence-based norms to compare whether students are falling behind expected rates of improvement.

-1	"This is regarding the new Math framework. I am a mom of 2 kids. One is in middle school and another going to college this fall. As if now, older one is pursuing a STEM degree. He took accelerated Math classes, enjoyed them and did fairly well. He wouldn't have gotten into his dream college if he would've not got the chance to take these classes. My younger one, a girl, is showing keen interest in the same direction. Gone through the college admission process and High School for the older one, I am beyond scared and disappointed and angry if the board decides on curbing the accelerated Math classes. Every kid is different , please let the parents, teachers and kids decide what they want to do. As you can't force everyone to take accelerated classes, similarly you have no right to take away accelerated classes from kids who can and want to pursue this path. US needs more of STEM graduates not less which would be very hard to nurture and produce if you decide to go on this path. "

-1	Please remove Jo Boaler from the committee involved in writing the California Math Framework. Please do not approve the framework as written. It must be rewritten with a new common-sense voice. Boaler fabricates data to suit her hypothesis and is highly unscientific. Untold children will materially be set back in a global marketplace if you proceed as is. The professional and academic world will view the approval of this math framework harshly if you don't turn back. 
-1	"Dear CDE, SBE, and IQC, I write to implore you not to rush the adoption of the CMF.  If the rumors are true and the next version will go from more than 900 pages to a comparably trim 600 pages the public has a vested interest in being allowed the opportunity to review such a vast revision and provide further comment before the CMF is summarily adopted. Please do not hastily approve a third draft of the CMF without allowing the public and those that have invested so much time already into the careful consideration (or in the case of Brian Conrad -dissection/evisceration) of the CMF with all of its merits, ideas, errors, and flaws. Please do not let this CMF go down in infamy as the time when the state board inadvertently canonized something that will come to be ridiculed as the balanced literacy version of math instruction.  Please, take a lesson from all of the Science of Reading zeitgeist and don't let this happen to math education in CA. A concerned parent, Henry Whynot " 
-1	"I am opposing this new Math Framework for California Public Schools because Math Content Standards are being replaced by 'big ideas' not written by mathematicians. Apparently the real experts (mathematicians) in the subject domain were not consulted enough or did not participate in defining this framework, which is not acceptable. Math and other STEM related subjects need to be learned with precision and followed with rigor for the students to be able to master it, which is a major goal of education.  " 
-1	"It is hard to disagree with some of the sentiments behind the CMF like the ideas that all children should be given the chance to succeed in mathematics, and children from some groups have had systemic obstacles to success. But there is a logical leap from these worthy points to the CMF's recommended interventions like detracking. While all children have potential, anyone who has taken a math class or works in a technical field knows that there is also such a thing as innate mathematical ability and it is not equally distributed in the population. Eliminating advanced classes, tracking, and selection tests removes the ability to assign children to material appropriate to their ability and current proficiency, and especially harms the highest achieving kids who are no longer challenged and stimulated in class. Much of the research that the CMF is based on and cites has weak quality. For instance, the non-peer reviewed paper 'Raising Expectations and Achievement: The Impact of Two Wide Scale De-Tracking Mathematics Reforms' by Boaler and Foster. Study 2 claims a benefit from an intervention in test scores by comparing scores on various tests in the pre-implementation year to a different test in the implementation year, which makes no sense statistically. By contrast, the most rigorous study of tracking, a randomized controlled trial led by Esther Duflo who later won the Nobel Prize, found a benefit to tracking among both the low- and high-achieving children (Peer Effects, Teacher Incentives, and the Impact of Tracking: Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation in Kenya).

My hope, in supporting this proposal is that these changes can help make math not only accessible, but help lay foundations for all the students to come.  " 
1	"1.Chapter 8 needs revision to show that the two pathways through the high school curriculum are alternative sequences through the same content stipulated in the California Standards. The current draft gives the impression that the content differs substantially. In the Standards and, therefore, in Chapter 8 functions and modeling with functions should be in the foreground for both pathways. The study of functions and their use to model real world phenomena is foundational for calculus and for data science. It is also a more intuitive and motivating path to more advanced mathematics for students from varied backgrounds with varied aspirations. 2.Appendix A, pages 2 through 8 should be deleted or rewritten to align with the content in chapter 8.

Also, teaching ideas that are broken down into the tiniest pieces (like 'Solving 1 step equations', 'Solving 2 step equations', etc) students don't understand how ideas and concepts are connected. A focus on Big Ideas is a great way to make more connections with concepts and allow students to retain information for longer. "

-1	"Dear California SBE. I oppose the current draft of the CMF. I believe that every child deserves to receive the best mathematics education possible. I believe that is justice. To fail to do this is an injustice. Reducing proficiency in mathematics doesn't help anyone. Use the social sciences to address social injustice. Don't use math instruction for this. Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content 
standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." 
1	"Please see the attached letter. Dear California State Board of Education Members, In 2022 the Lake County Office of Education (LCOE), in partnership with the Butte County Office of Education (BCOE), the Chico Math Project, and the North Coast Math Project, wrote a Learning Acceleration System Grant proposal to the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence (CCEE). This grant was approved and now funds a little more than eleven million dollars over a five year period to support mathematics education to 22 rural counties in California. Our group, the Rural Math Collaborative (RMC), has been engaged in providing a high-level of professional learning to our rural county offices of education, school districts, and teaching teams since May 2022. As a collaborative, we wanted to voice our support for the adoption of the California Mathematics Framework (item 11) on the July 12th agenda. Our work as the RMC is focused on the outstanding instructional strategies and supports outlined in the CA Mathematics Framework, namely lesson study, high-impact coaching, math intervention, and teacher professional learnin on this framework in particular. We are excited to see this on the agenda and look forward to its approval so that we may begin to engage our teams in a robust rollout of its contents. Thank you for the work you do to support our schools and educators. Please vote to approve the California Mathematics Framework on July 12." 
-1	"See attachment. Jelani Nelson Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley The most recent draft, as well as previous drafts, of the California Math Framework (CMF) state that the purpose of the CMF is "to support implementation of the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM)". Though the MIC pathway has been eliminated in this most recent draft, the CMF draft still continues to advocate for high school data science courses as alternatives to Algebra II or Math III (discussion of "Yesenia", Ch. 8, lines 793-794), contrary to the standards for college readiness as defined the CA CCSSM, our official state standards for K-12 mathematics. To quote the CA CCSSM (pg. 58): "The higher mathematics standards specify the mathematics that all students should study in order to be college and career ready". The model pathways defining what "higher mathematics standards" are meant is at the top of the same page, i.e. either the traditional pathway (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II), or the integrated pathway (Math I/II/III). Our state's standards are clear, and the purpose of the CMF, in its own language, is to support implementation of those standards. Any student wishing to go to college, to be college ready, should acquire the competencies provided by completion of one of those pathways, including "Yesenia" from Ch. 8, lines 793-794, the aspiring political scientist. The concept of a high school data science course is amorphous, with no standards, and with each data science course having different learning goals than any other. For example, the author of the most popular high school data science course in our state, UCLA's "Introduction to Data Science" (IDS), has stated that his course contains "just a dash of mathematical thinking", and indeed IDS' own materials confirm that it does not cover any non-statistics standards from Algebra II. The current CMF draft currently justifies its treatment of data science as third year mathematics by pointing at recent updates to Area C policy by the University of California (Ch. 8, pgs 34-35) allowing high school data science courses to be taken in place of Algebra II. However, in March 2023 the California State systemwide committee on Academic Preparation and Education Programs approved a formal resolution expressing frustration with the University of California system for approving high school data science courses that do not meet state standards. An article published just yesterday in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Stephanie Lee shows that at the UC, entire departments, and in some cases even Academic Senate leadership for entire UC campuses, have penned letters urging the UC to reverse this policy, which is also binding for the Cal State system. Thus, it is in my opinion highly likely that the UC will in the near future reverse this policy, making the CMF recommendations on high school data science out of sync with all of the state's public universities almost immediately. I thus urge the State Board of Education to either remove all mentions of high school data science, or to postpone a vote on the issue until after the University of California makes a final determination as to whether it will keep its current high school data science policy as is."

For successful implementation, the instructional practices outlined within this framework would require significant new and ongoing investments with resources not currently available. This is particularly notable in terms of time for planning, collaboration, and professional learning. All three are associated with significant fiscal investments. While the provision of the requisite resources is outside of its scope, the framework should present more detailed guidance for how to enact it with the constraints most schools face today. ¥ While Chapter 13 specifically discusses instructional adoption standards that incorporate supports for students with disabilities, the framework should provide more guidance to address the needs of this student population throughout the document. The changes suggested will require extensive professional development to help teachers support students with disabilities in conveying central themes of the framework such as "Big Ideas" and additional data science courses. Additionally, vignettes and teaching examples should include considerations forstudents with disabilities to make math instruction accessible and support California's move towards more inclusive practices. ¥ We urge the State Board and CDE to develop resources and tools to help districts communicate potential changes in pathways. Rather than have 1000 school districts individually attempt to design communication tools for family engagement and to build a shared understanding of the vision outlined within this framework, the state can play a vital role in supporting districts from the start.

-1	"I am an 18-year-old San Franciscan who is planning on majoring in mathematics in college. Ideally, any student who desires to will be able to progress through math at their maximum possible pace without reaching a maximum class. Single-variable calculus and statistics are currently framed as the highest goals of high school mathematics. Intelligent teenagers can and should take such classes as linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. I attended a private high school for gifted students where these three classes are considered part of the 'extended math core,' and are highly popular. In order to have time to complete such courses, students should be allowed to take more basic classes early and/or at an accelerated pace. I agree that 'students who specialize in mathematics may also understand that vectors and matrices are additional objects that can name new types of quantities and can be manipulated to understand those quantities, using operations similar (but not identical) to those of real numbers.' Therefore, a class on linear algebra should be offered. The truth is that the goal of within-classroom intellectual diversity comes at the cost of intellectual diversity as a whole. When students are grouped by ability, gifted students achieve greater outcomes at no cost to less gifted students. (Card and Giuliano, 2015, write that advanced black and Hispanic students 'gain 0.5 standard deviation units in fourth-grade reading and math scores, with persistent gains through sixth grade' when tracking is implemented in fourth grade, and that they found 'no evidence of either positive or negative spillover effects on other students in the same school/grade cohort,' a result echoed in many other studies.) This is desirable because it increases the overall amount of achievement. The framework states that 'students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade.' This is simply due to a selection effect. On page 7 of the chapter on middle school, it is unclear how some students will bring 'experiences, perspectives, and ideas that enrich the classroom for all' in the context of math class. Math is not related to life experiences other than very basic ones which are cross-cultural. The only 'experiences, perspectives, and ideas' that are useful in math class are ones which come from previous, creative, or quick mathematical thinking. As simple diagnostic criteria has proven more accurate than subjective clinical judgements, there should be a systematized and accessible process for students to be placed into whatever math class matches their knowledge. All students should be offered an Algebra I or Mathematics I course in eighth grade so that students from any background, even students in traditionally low-performing school districts, can have a chance to complete advanced math courses in college. I agree that schools should 'adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus,' or at least offer a compressed pathway as an option. However, providing both early algebra and high school course compression are desirable, because calculus is not the most advanced math class that high-performing students should be taking. I agree that 'if students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college,' and I am glad that the pathway for data science rather than Algebra II has been discarded. Students taking a mathematical science degree will be expected to know calculus. The statement that 'most college-level study in mathematics will expect considerable familiarity and comfort with manipulating algebraic expressions and equations and modeling with functions in order to solve problems and make certain features of functions apparent' is a considerable understatement. In Chapter 1, there is a discussion of 'rigor.' The provided definition is 'an integrated way in which conceptual understanding, strategies for problem-solving and computation, and applications are learned so that each supports the other.' I understand that the definition was knowingly altered to provide a simple reference term to refer to a core concept of the framework... However, 'rigor' is already a word, and its true definition is related to strictness and stiffness. It is not about subjective understanding, but about the unassailability of the logic. Neither does it have to do with strategies, and neither does it necessarily involve any applications whatsoever. Of course subjective understanding, useful strategies, and interesting applications are all necessary for mathematical pedagogy, but it is unclear why they have been here included under rigor. In fact, I am of the belief that logical rigor should be taught in school. If students learn how to read and write real proofs, then they will not only be introduced to higher math, but they will also learn valuable lessons about critical thinking and argument. On page 7 of the chapter on data science, it is stated that 'understanding of linear regression is closely related to understanding of functions and polynomials.' In fact, the concept of minimization of error which is essential to the understanding of linear regression is a concept from calculus. As the framework states, a data science degree requires calculus and linear algebra. These subjects are essential to the topic, just as geometry is essential to the understanding of calculus. Then, if the school system wishes to prepare students for statistical understanding, it should prioritize teaching students calculus (and linear algebra, if possible) as soon as possible. Much of the framework aspires to the effective use of visualization and computational tools with pre-loaded formulas. The productive use of such tools is certainly important, but it is not mathematics. The practice of formulating questions to be answered with data is in the purview of science, not math. Teaching this is math class will take time away from math if it is not being used to illustrate specific mathematical concepts, or taught only from probabilistic ideas. I am also concerned about the inclusion of environmental and social concerns in the math curriculum. Certainly, problems of society and the environment make reasonable examples of math applications for students. However, having an explicit goal of teaching EP&Cs in math class will necessarily compete with the goal of teaching math in math class. I understand that the decision that environmental education should be interdisciplinary has been made years ago, in a way unrelated to this framework, but environmental science certainly seems like a subject which should be taught in a separate science class (which integrates concepts learned in math class). The framework suggests that 'rather than seeking only to understand whether students can accurately demonstrate algorithmic proficiency on a single problem type, teachers hold a broader view of how students might demonstrate their mathematical knowledge and understanding.' This seems to be implying that if students are not able to apply algorithms properly, then teachers should change their standards and not require the algorithms. What is the purpose of teaching students math if they are unable to apply algorithms? The truth is that students do not possess 'mathematical knowledge and understanding' if they cannot solve math problems. It is true that it is beneficial to allow students to be creative and exploratory with the algorithms they use, but this is only possible when base algorithms are understood and built upon. As it says on the next page of the document, 'all students need to have a range of strategies and approaches from which to choose in solving problems, including, but not limited to, general methods, standard algorithms, and procedures.' Therefore, standard algorithms should be checked for understanding. I agree with the framework that 'an important aspect of this understanding is to recognize the power that algorithms bring to problem solving: knowing only single-digit multiplication and addition facts, it is possible to compute any sum, difference, or product involving whole numbers or finite decimals.' " 
1	"More pathways is better for students to connect to mathematics and their interests. Colleges are moving towards opening more pathways into math beyond just calculus (see the MAA-AMS-SIAM-AMATYC-ASA Common Vision report, introduction). The status quo is not acceptable.  " 
-1	"What a missed opportunity. Although I can tell the document has been revised, I do not see how this Framework will make an effective change to teaching practice. Any attempt to distill this document down will lead to misapplications and myth-based instruction. Although there is little use in playing 'what if', what would have happened if the committee had instead focused on how to implement research practices that improve achievement in an engaging way instead of focusing solely on uplifting inquiry as the only way to ensure active engagement? What if the CMF had been aligned with the IES Practice Guides for teaching mathematics and provided teachers with evidence-based instructional strategies and ways to implement them engagingly? Although the Common Core Standards and SMPs are indisputably important and useful ideas, the lack of a distilled set of instructional principles (other than telling teachers to always use rich, authentic tasks and center everything around student ideas) that teachers can put into practice is frustrating. Based on this revision, it seems inevitable that the impression that throwing students into authentic tasks is all that is needed for students to be engaged and learn, and that because standards are assigned to a grade band, no one teacher is responsible for ensuring students reach mastery on a concept, skill, or procedure. This, frankly, is a recipe for continuous unfinished learning that is passed from grade to grade. In addition, adopting the definition of 'fluency' that removes the explicit final goal of 'retrieval from memory' is setting up kids for difficulties, and the very anxiety in higher mathematics that the CFM is attempting to avoid. There is no question that the push to memorize procedures without ever teaching concepts was wrong. But the push to eliminate memorization Ð or at least downplay its importance to the extent you see it minimally mentioned only in an offhand way - is equally problematic. Although I appreciate the revisions that have so far been made, I do not believe this document is ready for release. (And frankly, there has hardly been any time at all to read and comment on this version!!) Others, like Brian Conrad, have pointed out continued misleading citations to research. And I am continually dismayed by the focus on inquiry as the primary method of teaching, as well as the continued denigration of any explicit, systematic instruction as 'passive' and 'lecture' and "lower-level teaching". Instead, they set up a false dichotomy between engagement and explicit instruction, and so it is no wonder the authors want the assessment processes to change. Based on prior research on the impact of inquiry on achievement, the results of this Framework's implementations are not likely to be good.  "

-1	"The CDE and SBE created a clever set up that creates the appearance of opening up the CMF for public comments while in practice it effectively runs the general public out of time to provide feedback. The current version of the CMF that the SBE is about to vote on retained and carried over several substantive flaws from the prior CFM/second field draft. These must be corrected. Furthermore, CMF has been written under a process fraught with conflicts of interest. The CDE and SBE should hire external legal counsel to evaluate this issue to provide clearance and not rely on its internal counsel that is biased to support internal processes. The current CMF cannot be approved in its current form and be allowed to influence math public education for 8 years. The SBE should be up to date on current issues and perform its due diligence that incorporates research and practical evidence that clearly illustrates that the current proposals in CMF do not work. For example, CMF references in lines 833-836 chapter 8 that data science is valid due to a UC BOARS policy resolution on area C (October 2020). Recently, California State University passed an academic senate resolution rejecting the UC policy (page 4, third full paragraph in the attached CSU 3599.PDF). Public education in the state of California is funded by both state and federal funding. The CDE effectively hired CMF writers employed by the owner of youcubed trademark ÐStanford University's Graduate School of Education (GSE) department - that sell teacher training into public schools on data science courses to write a data science philosophy into the math framework where funding for public education is coming both from state and federal resources. Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) in federal contracts requires that contractors who advise on establishing criteria should not be writing their own criteria into policies such that they can then turn around and sell their services funded by taxpayer funds. Yet the CDE and SBE did exactly that. It has been made crystal clear by 442 California based STEM professors (attached), exclusively from 4 year colleges, INCLUDING 100 Stanford STEM professors (NOT part of Stanford's Graduate School of Education department) that these shallow data science courses do not adhere to mathematical content standards and that data science is not a replacement for Algebra II. Dr Jelani Nelson from UC Berkeley and Dr Brian Conrad from Stanford are high profile advocates of the fact that there should be a CONTENT STANDARD established for data science. What criteria should be used for instructional materials? The CDE and SBE have made no efforts to establish objective criteria. Instead, a select group of collaborators from UCLA and Stanford's GSE during the CMF revision process over the last 3 years have been given a huge advantage over any competition (see attached emails). Education policy at the state level should be based on unbiased, academic research. Enclosure: 94 page document " 
1	"To: Members of the State Board of Education I support the adoption of the CA Mathematics Framework 2023. The framework focuses on - Integrated and Conceptual Understanding: The framework promotes an integrated and conceptual understanding of mathematics. Rather than focusing solely on procedural fluency, it encourages students to develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts and connections between different mathematical topics. This approach helps students develop a solid foundation in math and fosters a lifelong love for the subject. Problem-solving and Application: The revised framework encourages students to engage in problem-solving activities and apply their mathematical knowledge to real-world situations. Teachers, families, and partners support this aspect as it helps students see the relevance of math in their everyday lives and equips them with problem-solving skills that are valuable beyond the classroom. Collaboration and Communication: The framework emphasizes the importance of collaboration and communication in learning mathematics. It encourages students to work in groups, engage in mathematical discourse, and explain their thinking. This collaborative approach fosters a supportive and inclusive learning environment and prepares students for future teamwork and communication in various settings Respectfully, Alvin Salgarino Middle School Math Teacher  " 
-1	"Dear CA SBE, These current version of the CMF appears to be a large scale experiment. I recognize that some experimentation in teaching methods is helpful and appropriate, but this is to grans a scale. The human brain is quite capable of memorization. Removing the need for memorization is not helping our students or our society. "

-1	"Why would we prevent students from achieving their utmost by studying math topics that they are ready for when they are ready for them? Students with fewer outside resources will be at an unfortunate disadvantage if algebra is not permitted before 9th grade, as they are the ones who will not be as able to pursue the subject independently. Don't accidentally make the math achievement gap wider!  " 
1	"I support the new Revised CA Mathematics Framework. This much anticipated document is essential to the work of counties, districts, sites, and additional support providers as they work to support educators and all students to be successful in TK-12 mathematics. Mathematics can and has been a gatekeeper for students, especially those from marginalized communities and therefore a document like this provides research proven suggestions that will support teachers from multiple directions, including how to teach with big ideas, teaching with a lens of social justice, and suggested secondary pathways that are more equitable for all students. I strongly encourage the state board of education to adopt and accept the Revised Mathematics Framework. " 
-1	"This framework is heavy on DEI and FAILS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY TEACHING MATH . Since when did MATH become a political subject? Stop messing with our children's future with this ideology. Look at states/countries that actually have SUCCESS in TEACHING MATH! My recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful Ð like those in Massachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.  " 
-1	"Dear State Board of Education, I am writing to express my deep concerns about the proposed Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools and the very short period being provided for public comment on this version of the framework. Regarding the comment time, I understand the public is being given less than 2 weeks to comment, with a deadline of noon today--a deadline I'm barely meeting, even as someone who has done a lot of public-school advocacy the last few years. Given the short time frame and scheduling of comments during the 4th of July holiday period, it seems likely that many people who would be interested in commenting on such a major proposal won't even know about it in time. The CDE website states that 60-day review periods were provided for comment on prior versions of the proposal (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/), so why not provide a similar time frame for review and comment on the latest version? Regarding the substance of the math framework, I am concerned that it is based largely on ideological and personal views about teaching math and equity, rather than on evidence-based practices and real-world behavior. As a parent of two kids in SFUSD, we have seen that efforts grounded in ideology, however well-intentioned, have had harmful results, including in math. Just because you want something to be true doesn't make it so. For example, about 10 years ago, SFUSD, noting gaps between groups and the need for equity, embarked on an ambitious plan to change how math is taught, including by removing algebra from 8th grade. The results of this experiment? It was a failure, as SFUSD's Superintendent Matt Wayne has publicly acknowledged. Indeed, the gaps between groups grew even worse. Many families with more resources put their kids in private school or found workarounds such as tutoring and online classes to help their kids in math. And the most disadvantaged kids got the short end of the stick yet again, with even less opportunity to learn, to be challenged, and to excel. What you do--what we choose to do as a society--affects real people. I am very concerned by the framework's apparent reliance on many of Dr. Jo Boaler's recommendations, as SFUSD's math overhaul was strongly influenced by Dr. Boaler's views--and failed. I urge you to rely on evidence-based practices--the things we know work best--not 'one-size-fits-all' policies and approaches. We need to try to meet each child where they are at and give them the opportunity to succeed. We are all different, we all have different strengths and weaknesses, and we can all benefit from being challenged--wherever we may be starting from. Thank you for considering my comments. Sincerely, Supryia Ray " 
-1	"I am writing today as a San Francisco public school parent who strongly opposes rushing through changes to the CA math framework. Similar changes made to SFUSD's math framework have left students behind and unprepared for college. Dumbing down and single-tracking math does not result in better outcomes for low-income students are students of color. It harms everyone. Also, failing to focus math frameworks on MATH, not side issues like equity and the environment, means that students will learn less math. We must prepare our students for whatever comes next for them, and that means building a strong mathematics foundation for every child. Once they have strong foundations in math, only then can students apply math more broadly in other areas. You have rushed through a bad plan, and I am asking you to slow down and give time for evaluation and meaningful comment. Our kids deserve that. Thank you, Meg Kammerud San Francisco "

1	"Revision of California Mathematics Framework. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) highlight a commitment to bettering the lives of humans and the planet across seventeen (17) areas: recognizing that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth. SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. The State of California has fallen short with respect to SDG 4 in that many CA school districts, current teaching practices have resulted in only one-third of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures across the state. Additionally, most students are being pushed out of high-level pathways at a young age. Math education has been a gatekeeper to college and career success, preventing first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latino students, students with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to 4-year colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers. Mathematics instruction in California must be more effective and equitable. The revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics. Methods that are creative, inclusive, culturally responsive, challenging, and affirming for all students and that engage students more effectively. Strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace. Stand up for equity in education and for mathematics in particular: approve the revisions. This is not only about civil rights and human rights, but relates to the national security of our country: educated youth. " 
-1	"Dear California SBE. I urge you to reject this draft of the CMF because it doesn't provide a sufficient means for those students that are exceptionally talented in mathematics to pursue an accelerated path. Helping those that struggle with mathematics should not result in removing opportunities for those that excel in mathematics. " 
1	"As a current mathematics teacher in CA public schools, and a former student in the CA public education system, I am writing to express my support for the proposed California Math Framework. The framework provides appropriate guidance for districts, schools, and teachers to implement the common core standards for mathematics, placing a focus on diversity, equity, and deep understanding of mathematics. I am aware of numerous criticisms of the framework, and would like to speak to a few of these criticisms and why I believe they should be taken with a grain of salt when considering the goals for the future of California mathematics education. Firstly, many criticisms rely on analysis and criticisms written by Brian Conrad of the Stanford Mathematics Department. I attended Stanford University as an undergraduate in the late 2010s. During my time at Stanford, Conrad was a professor and director of undergraduate studies. Unfortunately, my experience with mathematics at Stanford revealed that the Stanford Math Department has no interest in increasing diversity, equity, or deep understanding of mathematics. I entered my freshman year as a high achieving math student, excited about mathematics and potentially interested in a major, but my first day of class made me feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged. Not because I was truly unqualified, but because the professor made it clear that asking questions would be interpreted as stupidity, that he expected the majority of us to fail the class, and that mathematics was an elite field meant only for some. Throughout my first year, I learned more about the math department that only supported these initial impressions -- particularly that there were nearly no faculty or lecturers who were women or people of color, and that the department building had only recently installed its first women's restroom. I chose to major in chemistry instead of mathematics so that I could continue exploring advanced mathematical ideas, but apart from the mathematics department. I still maintain that had I attended a different university, I would have likely majored in mathematics, but Stanford was not a welcoming place to do so. I bring my experience to your attention in order to underscore that though Brian Conrad may have interest in the subject, he has little to no authority to speak on mathematics education, and within his own field of influence, he has been a part of creating a space that is antithetical to the goals of the CA math framework. I am sure that we do not want CA students to feel alienated, incompetent, and discouraged when experiencing math class, and I feel that the math framework would allow us to move in a positive direction. Another criticism of the framework relates to the framework's advice on limiting tracking and acceleration in mathematics. As both a teacher and mathematics student who experienced acceleration, I can speak to the extreme negative effects it can have, not only creating significant gaps in understanding, but also causing students to 'burn out' on math, instead of fostering a love and joy that can last throughout college and career. Specifically, some criticisms argue that advice against acceleration are holding students back, and that prior to common core, all students used to take algebra in 8th grade, but now that is pushed to high school. I personally took 'algebra' in 8th grade under the standards preceding common core, and much of the 8th grade math curriculum under common core matches up with what was taught in 'algebra.' By contrast, the high school Algebra curriculum under common core is much more rigorous and requires much deeper understanding and fluency of connections between ideas than what was previously accepted. It is important for us as educators to focus on ensuring students have strong, interconnected and flexible understandings of mathematics - this is unfortunately lost when we allow for rampant acceleration. Because of this, I appreciate the framework's advice on limiting acceleration and I am hopeful for how it will support schools and districts in creating pathways that prioritize students' deep understanding. I am thankful for the work that has gone into creating and revising the Mathematics Framework over the past 3 years. I urge the board to adopt the framework so that we can move forward into implementing what is best for CA math students.  "

1	"Dear State of California Board members, Thank you for your thorough review of the revised draft of the proposed California Mathematics Framework. As a parent of two children in the K-12 system, seeing what they bring home for their math assignments, hearing the way they talk about math class, and looking at their achievement on the CAASPP, I agree that there must be a change to the way mathematics is taught. I appreciate the focus on looking at the big picture and emphasis on using rich tasks from which to teach. I appreciate that there is a place for students to excel but also to realize the relevance of mathematics. I support the adoption of the this proposed framework. Sincerely, Melanie Janzen "

California schools are in need of these guideposts that bring access and opportunity to all students with a mindset that all students can learn math at high levels. Please vote to support this adoption and allow schools and districts to move forward.  " 
-1	" Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus. 4 I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting.

Although Boaler's books have provided some work that can work and some that do not. What about research from https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26 [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!f2Z7UApKshjGd5lTMcXD_xqZEV4Ku2CFQh8_88x7lPCwdOYof3UT4WTQmeyfLz6yWUrH7djx1AFeoltVjZEQYx4$] My colleague was unable to find anything in our new Framework. More research must be done, not just one person 's research. Please consider putting off the adoption until additional research of good mathematical practices can be included. Thank You, Vicky Teel " 
-1	"I oppose immediate adoption of the CA Math Framework because Version 3 was made public only last Monday. Releasing it in the middle of the summer makes it virtually impossible for teachers, parents, students, district administrators and other stakeholders to provide their views. Acquisition of math skills is essential for California kids to be able to compete for STEM jobs and futures. Providing more education, training and support is a better route for all children than delaying Algebra to 9th grade. Please spend the time to seek and obtain input on Version 3. Thank you.  " 
-1	"This framework is heavy on DEI and FAILS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY TEACHING MATH . Since when did MATH become a political subject? Stop messing with our children's future with this ideology. Look at states/countries that actually have SUCCESS in TEACHING MATH! My recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful Ð like those in Massachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.  " 
1	"I strongly urge the State Board of Education to formally adopt the revised Math Framework as shared on its website. It is essential that California lead the way in rejecting the polarization of mathematics education that is currently gripping national politics. While it is true that any educational materials are political to some degree, let us not fall into the pitfall that claims that good math teaching and learning is somehow at the far extreme of a leftist agenda. Further, it would be ignorant to think that any framework that supports the education of all students is somehow limiting the success of some students. Talk to any public crowd at a grocery store and ask them how they liked their math education and you're likely to hear someone say, "I'm not a math person." We have to change this narrative. This framework makes strides to help students and teachers realize that everyone is a math person and anyone can learn math. The inclusion of data science is exciting and forward looking. The emphasis on multiple strategies, representations, and open ended tasks is based on research for what works best for students. As a district teacher of the year, and 25 year veteran with 5 years experience in specialized math instructional coaching, I urge you to please adopt this framework. " 
-1	"I strongly oppose the new California Math Framework and its stated goal of delaying Algebra (and all accelerated math in public schools) until 9th grade. Children should have the opportunity to pursue an education that challenges them, and allowed to accelerate in math if it is appropriate. The Framework will have a significant adverse effect on gifted and advanced learners, including my own child who placed into Algebra 1 in sixth grade and is thriving. Were this acceleration not offered in LAUSD, I would have no choice but to unenroll him from the district entirely.  "

SFUSD's reckless nonsense which was a complete failure. Remove all opposition to offering 8th-grade Algebra I.

All mention of that UC policy must be removed, and line 813-824 of Chapter 8 that is delusional nonsense. Chapter 1, lines 174-187, (Luculano et al., 2015) (really Iuculano) is still dishonestly invoked for a ``brain connections'' narrative. Chapter 1, lines 192-197 (Lambert and Sugita, 2016) on learning disabilities (falsely ``learning differences'' in the CMF) and (Freiman, 2018) on high-achieving students are absurdly said to often be about ``the same students''. Chapter 2, lines 475-8, (Esmonde, Caswell, 2010) is still described in misleading ways. Chapter 3, lines 480-2 and Chapter 6, lines 1550-2, cite (Carpenter 1997) to justify guidance about ``invented strategies'' but it was not a controlled experiment in teaching methods and says its conclusions ``cannot be generalized to all students.'' Remove this and all text it is used to support. Chapter 6, lines 414-8, (Sengupta-Irving and Enyedy, 2014) is falsely said to show``an instructional approach focused on mathematical practices may be important in supporting student achievement on curricular standards and assessments''; the control and experimental groups improved equivalently on assessments! Chapter 8, lines 641-657 still substantially distorts (Liang et al., 2012) and (Domina et al., 2015). Chapter 8, lines 894-907 still falsely claims to list student competencies. Chapter 9, lines 145-155 promotes an anti-tracking narrative with the same citation misrepresentation as before. Chapter 9, lines 156-192 opposes 8th-grade Algebra I based on an unpublished 2021 paper with major design flaws (akin to high school baseball players joining an 8th grade team: the improvement in performance implies nothing). Remove all citations of this and everything that rests on it. Chapter 12, lines 769-771 still dishonestly cites (Brookhart et al., 2016). Cited documents are missing from the bibliography: (Siegler et al., 2010), (Fischer et al., 2019), (Burris, Heubert, Levin 2006). In Appendix A, remove the useless summary in first half (before line 208) so the rest is more visible to teachers and parents. "

-1	" Seeing that 'data science' is advocated in the CMF as replacing Algebra 2, as a practicing engineer (I invented Shazam), I use Algebra 2 concepts EVERY DAY. They are fundamental to engineering. I am baffled by public comments, videos, and publications in which Boaler disparages Algebra 2 as 'outdated'. In a video, she specifically derides synthetic division. Synthetic division is used in infinite impulse response recursive filters in almost EVERY modern digital signal processing device. This includes speakers, microphones, AirPods, smart phones, WiFi, cable data, and more. Abstract forms of it are used in encryption and error correcting codes. They are computed millions of times per second, in your hands, ears, car, etc. Every time you use AirPods, drive a modern car, make a phone call, send an email, think of synthetic division. It is irresponsible to downplay the extremely relevant and fundamental set of mathematical techniques and tools whose fundamentals are taught in Algebra 2. If anything, the use and reliance of modern technology on Algebra 2 is increasing. It is not outdated. It is even fun: synthetically divide 1/(x^2-x-1) and you get the Fibonacci series. How can the CDE, an agency entrusted with ensuring that CA and the USA, be advocating a dead-end path to competitiveness in a world-wide market for engineers? In Silicon Valley, we hire engineers and scientists from other countries because we have a shortage of STEM-trained students. At Stanford, in the physics department, an observation was that US-born and very smart physics majors had to drop out of the program because they did not have enough math preparation vs their foreign peers. A very recent article in the Chronicles of Higher Education suggests that the Data Science approval as satisfying a UC(c) requirement might be retracted: 'Now, some members appear to be rethinking it. At BOARS committee meetings in March and April, representatives for the Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz campuses all voiced concerns about math preparation, minutes show. At one point, "members suggested that the previous BOARS' decision may have been rushed." A group of Black UC faculty members in data science-related fields sent a letter to the committee in May. "Introduction to Data Science" and courses like it, they wrote, "make claims that they specifically support learning for women and minorities, which are not only baseless, but fail to appreciate that they actually do the opposite and harm students from such groups by steering them away from being prepared for STEM majors." And the chair of Santa Barbara's mechanical-engineering department wrote to express "our strongest support for keeping Algebra 2 as a core requirement," as it "teaches concepts which are absolutely essential for our undergraduate students to succeed in our program." Please do not ram this through for approval. It is irresponsible to further weaken our students' competitiveness on a worldwide market for talent. "

CEA opposes the new Mathematics Framework developed by the California Department of Education (CDE), Instructional Quality Commission (IQC), and State Board of Education (SBE). The CDE website states that this framework will provide "...guidance designed to help educators align classroom teaching with California's rigorous math learning standards." Yet, the rigorous standards referred to by the CDE have failed to produce passing scores on national standardized math tests taken by California students, and California continues to rank in the bottom quartile. Additionally, on California's own Smarter Balanced state assessment, only 33% of students met or exceeded math proficiency standards last year. This is a failure on every level for California's students. The newly proposed Mathematics Framework should focus solely on teaching math. Time and instruction on side issues like identity, equity and social justice do not have a place in California's failing math curriculum. Those topics will not improve scores on state-wide and nation-wide standardized tests. As educators, it is your job to advise and implement instruction based on proven techniques and facts, not theories and ideologies that are untested and unproven in reputable journals or publications. We urge you to do better for California's students. Reject any and all components of the framework that do not solely contribute to creating a curriculum that will enable the majority of our students to pass standardized state and national tests.

-1	A Focus on Social Justice is replacing a focus on mastering math 
-1	"Math Content Standards are being replaced by 'big ideas' not written by mathematicians Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with "Big Ideas" aligned to 4 "Content Connections" which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the "big ideas" will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students (especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards ill-defined and vague "big ideas" which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered. A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: "This framework serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013." (Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly FAILED to do its job. In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you to reject recommends teaching "Big Ideas" as the content (see evidence below). Who decided the "big ideas" should replace the content standards (which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD's in MATHEMATICS and which were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)? According to the CMF, three individuals determined the "big ideas" for California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468 we read, "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following." Who are "Boaler, Munson and Williams" who apparently have the authority to determine what students in California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics). NONE of the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where "big ideas" created by non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce; the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers. Additionally, the CMF tells us these "big ideas" (chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of big ideas. "It should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation. Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas." (Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in California. Why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students' fate or allowing grade level teams (who typically involve teachers without math degrees) to decide what "big ideas" their students will learn. This will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation. Furthermore, in reading the CMF it is noted that the "big ideas" originated during distance learning. "So a focused set of big ideas, indicated as Big Ideas, was created as part of the California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance initiative (CDE, 2021). These grade level Big Ideas, organized by Content Connections, and inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards, are presented in the grade-banded chapters, 6, 7, and 8." (Ch 13 line 545). Note the use of the phrase "inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards"; why not ALL content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers? Evidence that the CMF wants to REPLACE Math Content Standards with their "Big Ideas" _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 6 line 228) _ "The foundational mathematics contentÑthat is, the big ideas' (Ch 6 line 942) _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 7 line 165) _ Teachers should be "Teaching from big ideas, not individual standards." (Ch 10 line 177) _ "Educators of pre-service teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authentic-context, big-idea-based instruction described in this framework." (Ch 10, line 247). So the "big ideas" proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past! This replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design, publishers, Teacher Preparation Programs, and grading as well. _ "This framework reflects a revised approach, advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas." (Ch 1 Line 405) _ "To help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep, active learning of mathematics for all students, this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs." (Ch 1 Line 50) _ "Planning teaching around big ideas, the first component of equitable, engaging teaching, lays the groundwork for enacting the other four." (Ch 1 line 361) _ "Design class activities around big ideas, with an emphasis on investigations and connections, not individual standards.' (Ch 1 line 590) _ "In the classroom, teachers teach the big ideas by designing instruction around student investigations of intriguing, authentic experiences relevant to students' grade level, backgrounds, and interests." (Ch 6 line 235) _ "These include designing lessons from a small number of big ideas in each grade band; spending a preponderance of student time on authentic problems that engage multiple content and practice standards situated within one or more big ideas; focusing on connections, to students' lives and among mathematical ideas; and using strategies that show connections between different mathematical ideas on various topics across grade levels." (Ch 10 line 789) _ "Instructional materials should primarily involve tasks that invite students to make sense of these big ideas, elicit wondering in authentic contexts, and necessitate mathematical 2 investigation. Big ideas in math are central to the learning of mathematics, link numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole, and provide focal points for students' investigations. An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. For example, environmental observations and issues on campus and in students' local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis. Such discussions will concurrently help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 8 line 147) _ "Mastery-based grading describes a form of grading that focuses on mastery of ideas rather than on points or scores. This approach is sometimes referred to as standards-based grading, and although it refers to standards, it does not have to focus on specific standards. It could, instead, use cluster headings, which are more akin to the Content Connections and Big Ideas approach of this framework." Ch 12 line 606 Note that not EVEN ONCE are the Math Content Standards Written out anywhere in the over 17,000 lines of text. How can the SBE adopt a CA math framework that does not even list the content standards students are supposed to learn? The math content standards were written in a logical order. As the CMF accurately notes, "California's mathematics content standards were built on progressions of topics across grade levels, informed by both research on children's cognitive development and by the logical structure of mathematics." (Ch 6 line 982). Later on we read, "The Common Core State Standards are based on an understanding of how young people typically develop mathematical knowledge and skills in a sequenced." (Ch 3 line 41) So why would the SBE adopt a CA math framework that recommends we shift away from this logical structure that is sequenced and built on research towards a single interpretation of "big ideas"? As Chapter 5 line 507 states, "As readers consider the three subsequent chapters of the framework, they will see ideas similar to the ones discussed in this chapter, organized to help them learn about and begin to use the big ideas approach. While the transition between standards domains and progressions discussed in this chapter and this new approach will not be straightforward for classroom teachers, both emphasize the central idea that students at all levels should have experiences that build their mathematical toolkits for making sense of their worlds." So the CMF is clearly suggesting a "transition" from standards domains and progression (those research based, logical, sequenced standards) to a "new" approach (big ideas) that will not be straightforward. This is not an experiment I want performed on CA public school students. We also read in Chapter 1 line 369, "To reach the goal of deep, active learning of mathematics for all, this framework encourages a shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction (see box). It instead encourages teachers to think about TKÐ12 math as a series of big ideas." What evidence is there to make these major shifts? In Chapter 2, line 287 the CMF states, "Rather than focusing on specific procedures and memorization, instruction is more effective when teachers aim to develop understanding of bigger ideas and procedures." What study do they cite to support this claim? NONE. The CMF is now making changes to instruction away from the standards based instruction California has implemented for over 26 years without ANY EVIDENCE. There are a number of major concerns (beyond the background of who wrote the big ideas and the lack of evidence they will help students become proficient in math, and the fact that one interpretation of this will replace standards based instruction. 1. The CA Common Core Standards for Math were written such that some standards were designated as "Major" and others were designated as "additional" or "supporting". It is 3 explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations) ,an, ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The CMF proposes that teachers "organize early-grade instruction around the Content Connections, which connect the mathematical big ideas." (Ch 6 line 153).The 4 Content Connections, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? How will it help students achieve proficiency in math and be competitive for STEM careers? As noted previously, the CMF proposed a "shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction." On what evidence and research is this proposed? The authors of the CA Math Content standards (which this CMF proposed replacing with big ideas) surely had and used evidence as they wrote standards and noted which were major. 2. Based upon what is written in the CMF (and the fact that the math content standards are NEVER listed or written out anywhere in the 14 chapters + 3 appendices), there is no reason to believe teachers will even address most of the content standards if they implement this CMF. _ The language of the CMF reveals not all standards will be addressed and further shows a lack of knowledge of the standards by the authors of the CMF. i. The CMF makes statements about instances when teachers might touch "multiple standards". "These chapters illustrate this framework's approach to instructional design by focusing on several big ideas that have great impact on students' conceptual understanding of numbers and that also encompass multiple content standards." (Ch 1 line 1699) Again in Chapter 8, line 922 we read, "As students explore and investigate with the Big Ideas, they will likely encounter many different content standards." ii. In another example, Chapter 3 line 812, we read about what teaching big ideas looks like in a classroom. The CMF states, "Students need time and opportunity to collaborate, critique, and reason about where to place the numbers on the number line (SMP.2, 3). For example, where might 4/7 be placed in relation to 1Ú2." This is great, but the problem is that this is describing a grade 5 classroom and the standards come from grade 4. Again, this gives the public no confidence that the authors of the CMF even know the content standards; further, this does not give the public confidence that our students, if the CMF is adopted, will have a chance to learn them. iii. In another example we read, "In sixth grade, students are introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers." (Ch 3 line 1302). Students are actually introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers in 4 BOTH the grades 3 & 4 content standards. Again I ask, do the authors of the CMF know the content standards? iv. In yet another example, the CMF states, "For example, content standard 4.NF.2 (compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators) may be addressed during an investigation in which students reason with data (CC1) and the same standard might also be addressed by lessons in which students take wholes apart and/or put parts together (CC3)." (Ch 6 line 301/431) This does not sound logical and well thought out but relies on when teachers "might" do math; given CA students' dire performance in math, we can not adopt a framework that has opportunities to possibly learn specific math. _ There are CONTENT STANDARDS MISSING from the "big idea" tables. While the CMF never tries to write out all the math content standards, it does attempt to at least list a standard number next to each big idea. However, in doing this, they SKIPPED 3 standards. The revision process of this third version of the CMF has lasted over a year and not one author can notice that 3 standards are missing? That is unacceptable! i. TK is missing NS 2.4: Solve simple addition and subtraction problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting. ii. Grade 2 is missing NBT 4: Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. iii. Grade 6 is missing EE 8: Write an inequality of the form x>c or x>c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x>c or x<c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams. iv. When a standard is written out, it is partially written out which is very misleading to an elementary teacher who has multiple subjects to teach and cannot be expected to memorize all the math standards. For example grade 3 notes the standard "Categorize shapes by attributes and recognize that different shapes may share certain attributes." (3.G.1) Unfortunately they left out the specific shape names listed in the actual standard (which include rhombus, parallelogram square and rectangle) so a grade 3 teacher reading the framework is likely to work on all shapes as opposed to the specific and narrow focus on quadrilaterals as called out in the content standards. _ Apparently to defend choosing not to write out the math content standards, the CMF argues "Given educators' more-advanced understanding of the individual standards, this framework focuses on connections between standards" (Ch 1 line 809) What about new teachers or those who switch grade levels? They surely don't know the standards. The CMF is happy to list the standards for 5 mathematical practice MULTIPLE times (e.g, Ch 4 line 378), so why can't we adopt a CMF that at least lists the math CONTENT standards once? 3. Examples of how to teach the "big ideas" through "content connections" reveal a clear lack of math knowledge of the writers of the CMF and give the public reason for concern if this CMF is implemented. Following are some specific examples of bizarre and illogical associations. _ Grade 2: "Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them." is listed under the big idea "Represent Data" How is cutting a rectangle "data"? _ Grade 2 MD 5 "Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem." This standard is listed under the big idea "Dollars and cents" How is "length" listed under dollars and cents? _ Grade 4: NBT 3 "Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place," and NBT 4 "Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm." These are both listed under the big idea of "Shapes and Symmetry", defined as "Draw and identify shapes, looking at the relationships between rays, lines, and angles. Explore symmetry through folding activities." _ Grade 5: "NF 4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. a. Interpret the product (a/b) _ q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of operations a _ q Ö b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) _ 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do the same with (2/3) _ (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) _ (c/d) = ac/bd.) b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas. 5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by: a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication. b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given number (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b = (n _ a)/(n _ b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1. 7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) Ö 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) Ö 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) _ 4 = 1/3. b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for 4 Ö (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 Ö (1/5) = 20 because 20 _ (1/5) = 4. c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to 6 represent the problem." Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! _ Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 4. An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, 7 students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? 5. The authors of the CMF clearly see their "big ideas" as rivals of the math content standards. _ We read, "Chapters 6, 7, and 8 set out an approach to mathematics teaching through big ideas that integrates mathematical content and practices instead of narrow procedures." (Ch 12 line 92). Why are the math content standards (which were written to reflect a BALANCE of conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency and application) now being called "narrow procedures"? _ In a sample rubric to help assess students, we read, "Student Strength: What does the student understand in terms of this standard? What linguistic and cultural assets possessed by the students can I tap into to support all students, including those on the road to English proficiency, in their mastery of the content? Student Area for Growth: What should the student focus on to strengthen their understanding of this standard? (Ch 12 line 112) This sounds like we're back to standards based assessment; the only problem is there are NO content standards listed; just "big ideas". The CMF is conflating their "big ideas" with "content standards" Textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed. _ To be eligible for adoption, programs must include a well-defined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards (Ch 13 line 239) _ Materials that fail to meet all of the criteria in category 1 (Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards) will not be considered suitable for adoption. (Ch 13 line 246) _ Instructional materials, as defined in EC Section 60010(h), must be aligned to the CA CCSSM Content Standards and SMPs, adopted by the SBE in August 2010 and modified in January 2013. (Ch 13 line 257) SBE, please hold the CMF to the SAME standard that the state of CA holds publisher to and require the CMF to address and list all math content standards. Do not allow three individuals of which 1 holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and none hold masters or doctoral degrees in mathematics to determine what students will learn in CA public schools. The 2013 CA Common Core Content Standards for math were well written, written by experts with authority and written based upon research about how children learn math. The 2013 CA Math framework did an exceptional job describing what those standards look like and what it means for students to master those. Please REJECT this CMF and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which has much greater promise of helping all students achieve in California."

We need students to be allowed to accelerate in middle school when grades don't matter and they can find themselves and experiment. The approach to acceleration in this CMF is devastating to anyone not in private schools (paying 50-60K/year) or who does not provide external tutoring and classes for students to compensate for this terrible public math education. The idea that restricting acceleration in math to high school to reach Advanced Placement Calculus in this CMF is HORRIBLE for mental health! During high school, students who did NOT get external tutoring in middle school will be compared to kids who did. In our district in Palo Alto many parents (including school board members) send their kids to private school during middle school when that delaning experiment was implemented just before the pandemic. Then they come back with all their enrichment and are compared to the parents who trusted public education to prepare their kids. Students also receive a lot of pressure to down-lane. It's destructive. Competition to get into college engineering programs is FIERCE and anyone who doesn't have AP calculus in high school has no chance, particularly if they don't have straight A's and 5's on their AP Calculus exam. The Data Science class is a pathway to a dead end and a signal to colleges that this student is not serious about STEM and yet this CMF emphasizes it. It's like a prize for participation designed to make students feel good but everyone knows it is useless. Get a STEM professional and a math professor like Brian Conrad on this writing team and LISTEN to what he says!!! Or go back to the 2013 Framework. Students are not widgets. They are individuals and need to be placed in classrooms that are right for what they need, not in some heterogeneous class that serves no one. Families need to be respected and told the truth about what successful preparation for STEM is. Stop sending us the useless CMF once and for all and throw this CMF version out!!!  "

The boundary is not a cross street/end of a street, but a fence dividing neighbors from each other.Fences are meant as property lines not isolating children from those a few doors down. Our children are growing up in the OGSD Community as their neighborhood/community. This is where we live and interact. COVID years were very tough on everyone but particularly difficult on young children. Our children went through significant anxiety issues. Being forced to go to the assigned schools of SJUSD would only make psychological issues worse.The assigned schools are located within 3 separate communities, none of which are walkable and would remove the children from their neighborhood peers & friends.

-1	"As a teacher, mother of two intellectually gifted (one highly gifted) children, and a gate coordinator, I am aware that not all students who take accelerated math classes benefit from the experience. However, my own two children have thrived accelerating in math. I made my 15 year old wait to accelerate until 7th grade and he has thrived and is more motivated in his math classes since accelerating as he is challenged and moving at a pace that matches his academic needs. My 12 year old accelerated in 6th grade and is scoring over 100% in math. I only let him accelerate by taking a course that covers 6th and 7th grade standards in one year and he has thrived. Being in an accelerated highly gifted magnet has motivated and challenged him in ways the "general" grade level classes were not. I do see that skipping years of math can be problematic for the general population of students, but for those who clearly have mastered grade level standards should not be slowed down or held back because of "new standards rules". Students do not learn at the same pace and should be allowed to take math classes that meet their individual needs.  " 
-1	"I am a mathematician (BA with distinction from University of Pennsylvania). Part of my doctoral research involved analyzing active learning methods for teaching introductory calculus to undergraduates. I tutored, mentored and taught Philadelphia magnet, traditional, and charter public school students of all ages throughout my 10 years in that city. I am also a father of one deeply committed to public education. The stated goals of the new math framework are laudable, but the methods will frankly not achieve those goals, and in the process will irreparably harm the schooling of millions of Californian public school children. Tens or hundreds of thousands more will be driven away from the public school system, leaving those who remain in public schools even further behind. Dr. Boaler's work is the bedrock of this framework. She is cited 28 times, more than any other but the CA DoE itself, and 4x more than any other single human author. To rely so heavily on the work of a Nobel Laureate would be questionable; to do so for an author whose work is so highly controversial is plain irresponsible. Go back to the drawing board and start by involving a wider spectrum of voices into the curriculum design process, or risk undermining the future of public education in California. "

1	"I am a professor of mathematics and am excited at the potential for this Framework to enable more of my students to enter university with an understanding of mathematics as a set of tools for examining situations they wonder about. I believe that the diverse group of educators on the CFCC did an excellent job of shaping a vision of math education in which all students have opportunities to encounter deep, connected mathematics. As a member of the team of writers hired to help the CFCC put ideas into language, I got a good appreciation for the thought and care that went into the emphases they chose for the Framework. The proposed Framework represents an excellent step forward, as we learn from 13 years of experience with the California Common Core Standards in Mathematics. Focusing instruction around the standards' big ideas, and helping students experience math from a place of curiosity and connection, will go a long way towards substantially increasing the group of students who enter college as competent, confident math (and more broadly STEM) enthusiasts.

The framework has created testing requirements that are more of a challenge in the recent years. As we are seeing more efforts to bring younger students into the educational setting along with an increase of students needing specialized academic learning services, I believe more research into best practices for the teaching of younger students and students with disabilities needs to be addressed.

This situation is addressed by the 2023 CA Math Framework as recommended by the California Department of Education (CDE).

It ensures the progression of mathematical understanding of students and supports culturally diverse learners, EL, and students with disability with instructional practices.

Figure 8-4 exemplifies my point: (my comment including the figure is attached) Where is the clear and accessible path to completing foundational math and Calculus and Statistics? My district, San Francisco Unified (SFUSD), struggled with implementing Common Core Math and providing easily accessible pathways to the foundational math through Calculus. SFUSD created two options: an inaccessible for all pathway and an "antithetical" compression course pathway. Make no mistake: those with resources found workarounds to SFUSD's pathways and will find workarounds to this Framework. I'm writing on behalf of those with limited access to resources.

Additionally, some students may not be particularly good at math but may still be intellectually gifted and extremely talented in other fields of study. Lowering math standards does not help those students, it only has potential to distract them.

With this in place, the implementation of higher concepts is attainable and with fewer errors in basic math issues in the upper grades. This can be achieved while incorporating critical thinking skills and building a life long interest in mathematics. "Hands on Algebra"in the early years (3-5) is a game changer in order to promote a zest for math and take the fear out of the subject for many students.

We can even refer to the Governor of California, his four kids are attending private school which provides extra resources and advanced classes vs public schools.. 3) K-12 is to give building blocks and a strong foundation. California kids will be in disadvantage comparing to kids from other countries.

To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM.

While the third draft of the CMF shows some improvement over the second field review, primarily the removal of the Mathematics: Investigating and Connecting (MIC) pathway as a third proposed pathway in chapter 8, the overall document retains too many of the problems present in the first and second drafts to be salvageable. As to the issues that persist with the third field review of the CMF that make it unsalvageable: - While acknowledging the failings of California's public schools on the whole in providing minimal mathematics instruction to its students, the CMF merely asserts that the solution is to adopt the CMF writers' preferred instructional approaches. There is a large body of research and experience that indicates alternative approaches would better close math achievement gaps and improve mathematics instruction. - The lead writer of the CMF writing team -- Jo Boaler -- had a conflict of interest because much of the 'research' cited to support the authors' claims, particularly with regard to detracking, as well as approaches recommended come from her own for-profit organization - YouCubed.org [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://YouCubed.org__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!ffOThZtjZ6QKlo8imzM6BLCiFJTgsaLW8bRZnpL2UlGfHdQ7QYC-z4W7eWJEyUelAkb_Z02jSXxU8242aDc$]. Boaler earns substantial income consulting with CA public school districts advising on mathematics curricular changes. - The CMF is an overly political document that focuses on equity from the first chapter. Chapter 1 states, 'Reflecting the state's commitment to equity, every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all.' Two entire chapters -- 2 and 9 -- are devoted exclusively to equity as the authors define it. That understanding of 'equity' can be gleaned from the Glossary in chapter 14 of the CMF: 'Equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness. Drawing from Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power.' The third and fourth dimensions of 'equity' are by the author's own admission in her 2012 paper rooted in critical theory. A curriculum framework should not contain a political orientation or political recommendations. - The instructional recommendations recommended in the CMF are poorly supported, ignore research that supports competing recommendations, and are often justified by dubious research or questionable summarizations of the research cited. This is tacitly acknowledged by the WestEd researchers hired to write the third field review as they removed references to San Francisco Unified School District's failed policy of delaying Algebra 1 to 9th grade, yet claims continue to be made based on those references. - If the instructional and policy recommendations in the CMF are followed by California school district's, it is my informed opinion that California K-12 students' achievements in mathematics will continue to decline. The first chapter of the CMF says it is 'centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs.' This focus on big ideas, connection to 'authentic' student contexts, and vague notions of 'multidimensional ways' rooted in UDL will necessarily reduce instructional time in development of basic mathematical skills.

1	"For 21 years I have been a K-8 educator. Most of my students have been students of color, low socio-economic backgrounds, English Learners, with learning differences or a combination of all these. I have taught using both traditional pedagogy and culturally responsive, equitable pedagogy. I've seen first-hand how much difference in student outcomes it makes to use culturally responsive and equitable practices with our most vulnerable students. Math success is not only important in the lives of the individuals we serve, but also for our community at large. The future of the California economy and quality of life for everyone in our state depends on the quality of Mathematics instruction of ALL students in public education today, not just some students. This 2023 revised framework gives schools the guidance necessary to produce positive outcomes for every student based on well-established research and field experience. If the pedagogy described in the framework enhances the mathematical success of all students, how can we NOT use it? I support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework wholeheartedly because I believe in our students and I believe in our educators to meet the important challenge of educating every student, no matter who they are.

1	"Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education: The leadership team at Loyola Marymount University's Center for Equity for English Learners extends its appreciation for the diligent work and efforts of the committee and the writers responsible for the revision of the Mathematics Framework. We commend the Instructional Quality Commission and members of the CFCC for drafting a Framework that centers equity and engagement in California's vision of excellence in mathematics education. We are writing regarding Agenda Item 11: Adoption of the 2023 CA Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve The Math Framework is a critical resource that can provide guidance on mathematics instruction centered around equity and access, including the specific needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students in California. During the last review cycles, CEEL has partnered with several organizations to lead advocacy efforts for equity and access in our joint focus on English Learners. As such, CEEL co-signed letters submitted by Californians Together and other organizations. Collectively, we have included comments and suggestions to recommend that chapters incorporate relevant pedagogical practices framed within principles of equity and access for English Learners and traditionally marginalized groups of students. Our goal has been to ensure that the revised Mathematics Framework provides guidance to ensure greater rigor, relevance, and access for all of California's students, with a particular focus on the students who are most underserved in mathematics. Teachers need high-quality instructional guidance, support, and materials now, to engage all students effectively and equitably in mathematics learning. We respectfully encourage the SBE to continue moving forward in the recommendation of revisions that deepen and strengthen the explicit equity focus in support of all learners including Multilingual/English Learners. Therefore, we urge the State Board of Education to consider the recommendations included in the attached document and to adopt the revised framework at its July 2023 meeting so that the instructional materials adoption process can commence and so that teachers and school leaders can begin to learn about and implement the framework. Attached, we respectfully include the LMU-CEEL's statement to the CA SBE. We continue to offer our support and respectfully reaffirm our comments and suggestions focused on key recommendations for chapters 2, 12, and 13. Sincerely, Magaly Lavadenz, Ph.D. Leavey Presidential Endowed Chair in Moral and Ethical Leadership & Executive Director, Center for Equity for English Learners Elvira G. Armas, Ed.D.

-1	"I completely agree with Mike Lawler's comments on the CMF. He said: The prior drafts of the CMF had serious problems with accurate and appropriate references. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include: (i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to 9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and (ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math. Problems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either removed or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the items in the CMF that depend on the nonacademic references need to be removed, too. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be removed, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the non-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California Department of Education. For example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is Mathematical Beauty- is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for books written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having a reference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate. A second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raisin~ Expectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It is inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the CMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper - that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student achievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th grade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in Chapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or explanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling. The claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important claims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published academic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited in the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic research. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only discussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the discussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed. There are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the CMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure that the Ideas In the document are supported properly. Non academic work like blog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as academic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about opposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot be central to the CMF's proposal either. Once the references are corrected (or the material removed), what remains in the CMF can be evaluated properly. " 
-1	"The CMF is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus."

-1	"Dear State Board of Education Members, I have concerns with the current mathematics framework, and would recommend additional emphasis on offering accelerated mathematics tracks for any California middle- or high-school students with sufficient aptitude and desire to enroll. I am writing as a private citizen and professional engineer. Accelerated math tracks, specifically algebra in middle school and pre-calculus + calculus in high school, were essential preparation for me when I enrolled in my core undergraduate math courses. Even with a strong foundation, it was challenging to keep up with peers as we quickly moved through matrix algebra, integral + differential calculus, and statistics in our first year. This mathematical training was foundational for our future careers; I am currently at a materials company developing next generation components for lithium ion batteries. I can directly trace how my mathematics training supported my decision to enter a STEM field, and to participate in an innovative business located here in California. It's not fair or equitable to take away accelerated math tracks from public school students. By watering down or eliminating accelerated math tracks in California public schools, the current framework makes it difficult for our students to thrive in STEM careers. In fact, I'm concerned it will exacerbate inequality, making it harder for our public school students to access advanced math training. Please consider placing additional emphasis on accelerated or honors classes in the adopted math framework. Instructors such as Professor Conrad at Stanford University have provided more specific recommendations on ways to improve the current framework; I'd encourage the Board to adopt them: https://sites.google.com/view/publiccommentsonthecmf/ [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://sites.google.com/view/publiccommentsonthecmf/__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YHOG3G4PI3xgCRmkFbzb8-ipxi-MoTU2_Vi6hvA8E2PIoYBXujDfsqDFZjnA2Aw4a-JZQBY0-LelOvfJ9g$] Kind Regards, William " 
1	"The new math framework is a step towards creating more access and opportunity for students to develop mathematical thinking and problem solving. Current neuroscience research shows that all students have the ability to learn and grow given strong instruction and learning opportunities. The way this framework is set up gives teachers the ability to provide students of diverse skill and backgrounds entry points for learning and no limits to their learning trajectory. As an educator, I want students to be able to come into the classroom and meet their needs. It moves away from the outdated ideas that only certain students are "math gifted" or have "math brains". This is an important way for Califorina to invest in all of our students - by seeing the potential in each of them. Empowering students with the mathematical thinking and analytical skills will create stronger individuals who are ready for college, careers, and community engagement. Even if students do not pursue a STEM career, they would be able to use concepts to do data analysis, problem solving, and critical thinking in professional and personal environments. There is skepticism about "detracking" students and whether this will diminish students ability to excel in a diverse classroom. However, math can be multidimensional and creative in its approach without diminishing rigor. Teachers have long differentiated instruction to meet student needs. If students are in a diverse classroom, they all benefit from the divergent thinking and approaches to math. They will be able to learn from one another and the multiple perspectives that are in the classroom. There are no limits in learning. Using this framework, classrooms could also become more collaborative, inquiry based, and engaging. Students who are more engaged in classes are more likely to stay on task and reach learning objectives. This framework is a foundation for schools to launch academic programs and instruction that will meet the current needs of our student population. It is an investment in our future that will support our state and nation because it empowers a new generation of learners, thinkers, and creators. " 
-1	"Dear Sirs, If you design math education for kids who hate math, you're punishing kids who like math. It's self-defeating, and that's what you're doing here. If you want to solve the problem that elite college admission departments require too much calculus, you ought to take it up with elite college admission departments. They are, after all, the ones wholly in charge of elite college admissions. Just limiting how much math you are willing to teach the California students who love math Ð and they exist! I was one! I am raising two! Ð is an absurdly roundabout and likely totally ineffective way to achieve your stated goals. Instead, I humbly suggest that you build more schools for the academically gifted, not fewer, and build them in minority neighborhoods, not in the San Fernando Valley. And maybe change how the HGM admission testing works! There's nothing magic about the way you're doing it now. Sincerely, Lewis Morton Parent of 2 kids in LAUSD " 
-1	"I am writing as a parent and stakeholder with two children in California's public school system. My children attend high school and middle school in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the city of Los Angeles, CA. They have attended CA public schools since they were in kindergarten. (Stakeholders are addressed in Ch. 1 of the California Math Framework.) Our family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both traditional math programs and models that align with the new California Math Framework in their respective schools. Having lived experience with the recommendations put forth in the CMF, I am writing to urge the CA BOE to reject the proposed California Math Framework in its current form. I have heard the phrase, "your children are not a data set," but they are the data set I know the best. My kids took math at public schools that have adopted the recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did not. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF models of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs that did not employ the CMF's recommendations. My children's first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont Charter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF's proposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves with the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA's Center X / UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their curriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work building on Carol Dweck's "growth mindsets," which guided them in creating model math classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with engaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD. The resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of whom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework, which was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about their thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper, which followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and discovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, "I can't believe Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!" Using a standard algorithm (and justÉdoing math problems) made everything click into place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the current CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until much later in elementary Ð using culminating standards as a guide of when to teach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the Common Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division, etc. are taught, CMF page 83.) But Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in LAUSD, our child's former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a pilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola switched from teaching the "Big Ideas" math curriculum to "Illustrative Math" in 2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of thousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new curriculum. Again, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was a disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de Portola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically work 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about the Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new curriculum. One parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem set in both the "Big Ideas" (traditional) textbook and the (new) "Illustrative Math" textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the new progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our principal, which I am excerpting here: "As for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola's initiative and effort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state of math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the country. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited to many, if not most student's needs and ability. IM tries to make students fully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by reorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various ways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is benefitting from IM's methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace." "However, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids' needs well at all (especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and is a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does not prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and Calculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and approach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math." "Here are some of the IM's shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in the context of HGM (especially Algebra 1&2, and Geometry):" - "IM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower knowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into materials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It offers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which bores and even confuses students." - "IM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and seems to be a 'watered-down' version of traditional math textbooks." - "IM's approach does not align with that of college textbooks." - "IM doesn't offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each lesson/chapter for students to further their investigation and study after school." - "IM's lesson/chapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard mathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for a smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics." É - "We have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math. Having them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching seems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise." - "Because of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents are compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and unnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home." "Overall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general student population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection for the HGM students." (End of excerpted letter) Here, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the general shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying principles and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several chapters of the CMF. In two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new progressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it came to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did it adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the repetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and again) temporarily killed the fast learners' love of math. At scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by making high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered. Those learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal Development. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re: gifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing Ð it's all a growth mindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math Placement Act to support their academic growth. All this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in CA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with the math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups. However, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a document that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not offer solid data and peer-reviewed research to support their hypothesis that their drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more equitable for those who need it most. In previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School District's "success" with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their approach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD's program surfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears that SFUSD's de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the math achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could prepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive supplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround. Economically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take the private classes. (See: "SFUSD's delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare of workarounds" by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023) While SFUSD's failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the CMF, the model that drove SFUSD's failure remains the proposed math model of choice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the authors' hypothesis without hard facts to back it? The CMF authors' biggest argument against traditional math is that it perpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated classes and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data science) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in college into a new dead end. As Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data science as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the effect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking accelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an entirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career that may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math Ð that may bar them from STEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following article just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, "The University of California Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren't Happy" by Stephanie M. Lee, 7/6/23. The article backs up Conrad's many critiques of Chapter 5 of the CMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed before moving forward. The problem with "tracking," after all, is getting stuck on a track. However, when tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at an appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in large public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the curriculum getting dumbed-down into a "one sized fits all model." Why was this solution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the CMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn't work) when math models like those employed in the Long Beach Unified School District Ð where kids can be taught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually proven to deliver more equitable results? Finally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about their data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the authors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, "The most organized resistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change (see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the California Math Framework have been met with similar opposition." Like many big sweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study. It does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM professionals Ð or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the head of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a YouCubed blog post. And here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this current framework that do not hold up under scrutiny. There should be no non-academic research included in the CMF. Non peer-reviewed papers have no standards. They have no business being used as references for a math framework designed to change the schooling of millions of students. Blog posts and opinion pieces must be removed for the CMF to have any credulity as an academic document. The many references to YouCubed and the CMF authors' commercial concerns must be removed. (Given the sheer amount of new textbooks that will be required by the new CMF, it is a massive conflict of interest to make this document an infomercial for the YouCubed group.) The new revised CMF still reads as an aspirational document. It is a massive hypothesis without the peer-reviewed data to back up its assertions. While it has been clear for some time that the CMF math models do not work for the fastest learners, the CMF will more gravely change math for all children in the state in the name of equity, with no proof that its methods and models are able to deliver equitable results for students who are at the most risk of being sidelined in math. As a parent stakeholder whose family has been the test case for this big ideas and concepts aligned with this math model, I urge you to vote "no" on adopting the revised CMF. Thank you. I am writing as a parent and stakeholder with two children in California's public school system. My children attend high school and middle school in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in the city of Los Angeles, CA. They have attended CA public schools since they were in kindergarten. (Stakeholders are addressed in Ch. 1 of the California Math Framework.) Our family is in a unique position in that our children have tried out both traditional math programs and models that align with the new California Math Framework in their respective schools. Having lived experience with the recommendations put forth in the CMF, I am writing to urge the CA BOE to reject the proposed California Math Framework in its current form. I have heard the phrase, "your children are not a data set," but they are the data set I know the best. My kids took math at public schools that have adopted the recommendations contained in the new CMF and math at public schools that did not. Both of my children struggled in the programs that adopted the proposed CMF models of instruction and found much more success in more traditional programs that did not employ the CMF's recommendations. My children's first elementary school was an independent charter named Larchmont Charter School in Los Angeles. Larchmont was an early adopter of the CMF's proposed models. Years before other public schools worked to align themselves with the new CMF, faculty at Larchmont Charter School worked closely with UCLA's Center X / UCLA Mathematics Project to incorporate CGI Math into their curriculum. Larchmont teachers followed Jo Boaler at Stanford and her work building on Carol Dweck's "growth mindsets," which guided them in creating model math classrooms for their students. Larchmont was a high-performing school with engaged faculty who understood and enthusiastically followed the PD. The resulting math program, however, was not effective for my two kids, both of whom work several years above grade level. My students bemoaned the coursework, which was remedial, repetitive, slow-paced, and featured a lot of writing about their thinking for very simple concepts. Once they moved over to LAUSD proper, which followed a more traditional math path, they both soared ahead and discovered they loved math. In fifth grade, my daughter remarked, "I can't believe Larchmont never taught us the standard algorithm!" Using a standard algorithm (and just...doing math problems) made everything click into place for these particular kids. I was therefore dismayed to see the current CMF recommend holding off on teaching certain standard algorithms until much later in elementary Ð using culminating standards as a guide of when to teach something rather than using them as a final goalpost as intended in the Common Core (see elementary school guidance re: when multiplication, division, etc. are taught, CMF page 83.) But Larchmont was not our only brush with progressive math models. Last year, in LAUSD, our child's former school, Gaspar de Portola Middle School implemented a pilot program for the district that was aligned with the new CMF. Portola switched from teaching the "Big Ideas" math curriculum to "Illustrative Math" in 2022-2023. Teachers underwent extensive PD. Parent booster groups spent tens of thousands of dollars on new interactive math boards required for the new curriculum. Again, the progressive math model (executed by excellent teachers and staff) was a disaster for the outliers who were ready to move at a faster pace. Gaspar de Portola Middle School houses a Highly Gifted Magnet (HGM) for kids who typically work 3 years ahead of grade level. Parents at the HGM, (knowing nothing about the Math Wars raging in Sacramento) were incredibly dismayed by the new curriculum. One parent, a STEM PhD and retired astrophysicist, patiently did every problem set in both the "Big Ideas" (traditional) textbook and the (new) "Illustrative Math" textbook to try and understand the rationale behind the adoption of the new progressive model. Dismayed by what he found, he wrote a letter to our principal, which I am excerpting here: "As for IM, first of all, I strongly applaud LAUSD and Portola's initiative and effort to bring a different approach to math education given the current state of math proficiency in the general student population in LAUSD and in the country. IM textbooks and its corresponding methodology may be very well suited to many, if not most student's needs and ability. IM tries to make students fully understand mathematical concepts instead of rote memorization by reorganizing math topics, offering a lot of repetitions, and showing various ways to explain the same concepts. My son (*name withheld) I believe, is benefitting from IM's methodology, repetitiveness, and slower pace." "However, I have to say that IM does not serve HGM kids' needs well at all (especially to those who are taking highly accelerated math path and beyond) and is a poor fit to their unique intelligence and capability. Ultimately it does not prepare them well for later and more advanced courses like Pre-Cal and Calculus in high school and college since those classes use methodology and approach that are more in line with traditional textbooks like Big Idea Math." "Here are some of the IM's shortcomings as a high-school level math textbook in the context of HGM (especially Algebra 1&2, and Geometry):" - "IM covers a much smaller list of math topics and provides a much narrower knowledge base due to its slower pace. It does not delve deep enough into materials, compared to Big Ideas Math and other common core math textbooks. It offers repetitive and sometimes cumbersome ways to elucidate concepts, which bores and even confuses students." - "IM lacks the necessary theoretical and mathematical rigor and accuracy and seems to be a ""watered-down"" version of traditional math textbooks." - "IM's approach does not align with that of college textbooks." - "IM doesn't offer enough texts, guidelines, and exercises after each lesson/chapter for students to further their investigation and study after school." - "IM's lesson/chapter summaries are very rudimentary and omit many standard mathematical terms, equations, theorems, and conventions that are essential for a smooth transition to future courses such as Calculus and Physics." ... - "We have math teachers at HGM who are highly skilled in using Big Idea Math. Having them switch to a very different and possibly inferior way of teaching seems to be a huge waste of their talent and expertise." - "Because of the deficiency of the IM textbook and curriculum, some HGM parents are compelled to seek outside help and tutoring, which adds extra and unnecessary workload and burden to students and parents at home." "Overall, I believe that whilst IM may be a suitable choice for the general student population, it is unfortunately an inadequate and unsuitable selection for the HGM students." (End of excerpted letter) Here, the critique of Illustrative Math can be extrapolated and applied to the general shape of the math curriculum put forth in the new CMF, as the underlying principles and techniques are similar to those outlined in the first several chapters of the CMF. In two separate schools in two separate examples, our family discovered that new progressive math curriculum aligned with the CMF was woefully inadequate when it came to addressing the specific set of learning needs of high achievers. Nor did it adequately prepare students for college level math. The slow pace and the repetition of the more progressive math models (which circle back again and again) temporarily killed the fast learners' love of math. At scale, the proposed CMF recommendations will potentially violate state law by making high achievers repeat classes and concepts they have already mastered. Those learners deserve to experience growth within their Zones of Proximal Development. Further, despite the CMF throwing out decades of research re: gifted learners (by asserting that there is no such thing Ð it's all a growth mindset) these learners require appropriate placement as guaranteed by the Math Placement Act to support their academic growth. All this said, the population of learners who needs the most help with math in CA is not the group of outliers at the top. The CMF is rightly concerned with the math achievement gap between various ethnic, racial, and cultural groups. However, this is also where the proposed CMF is at its most cynical. For a document that is primarily concerned with equity, the authors of the CMF do not offer solid data and peer- reviewed research to support their hypothesis that their drastic overhaul to math education in CA will actually make anything more equitable for those who need it most. In previous drafts of the CMF, the authors cited San Francisco Unified School District's "success" with de-tracking Algebra in 2014 as proof that their approach to revamping K-12 math worked. When new information re: SFUSD's program surfaced, the available data did not support that claim. In fact, it now appears that SFUSD's de-tracking experiment was a disaster, further exacerbating the math achievement gap for black and Latinx students. The only way students could prepare for the accelerated classes in high school was to take expensive supplemental math outside of their public schools as a workaround. Economically-disadvantaged kids continued to be the ones least likely to take the private classes. (See: "SFUSD's delay of algebra 1 has created a nightmare of workarounds" by Rex Ridgeway, San Francisco Examiner, March 8, 2023) While SFUSD's failed math experiment has been removed from this draft of the CMF, the model that drove SFUSD's failure remains the proposed math model of choice for the California Board of Education. Why? What data supports the authors' hypothesis without hard facts to back it? The CMF authors' biggest argument against traditional math is that it perpetuates inequity via tracking. Their solution is to remove accelerated classes and de-track, but they wind up proposing a whole new track (data science) that will heartlessly trap kids who were hoping to enter STEM majors in college into a new dead end. As Brian Conrad of Stanford has explained at length, when students take data science as an alternative to the pre-requisite they actually need, calculus, the effect will be to kill their STEM careers before they start. How is taking accelerated math in middle school a problem, but encouraging kids to pursue an entirely new data science track for the entirety of their high school career that may or may not meet UC standards for advanced math Ð that may bar them from STEM majors - not a dirty trick? Here, the BOE must consider the following article just printed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, "The University of California Changed Its Math Standards. Some Faculty Aren't Happy" by Stephanie M. Lee, 7/6/23. The article backs up Conrad's many critiques of Chapter 5 of the CMF. The inequity and issues that the data science track poses must be addressed before moving forward. The problem with "tracking," after all, is getting stuck on a track. However, when tracks are turned into pathways with many entryways, students can learn at an appropriate pace with a similar ability group (a much needed grouping in large public schools). They can even level-up to a new group without the curriculum getting dumbed-down into a "one sized fits all model." Why was this solution not considered? Why is the de-tracking model used in SFUSD still in the CMF (without the accompanying data showing it didn't work) when math models like those employed in the Long Beach Unified School District Ð where kids can be taught on different pathways that they can leave and enter - have actually proven to deliver more equitable results? Finally, the authors of the CMF have targeted anyone raising questions about their data, methods, and models as politically-motivated. In Chapter 9, the authors assert re: the Common Core adoption of 2001 that, "The most organized resistance came from politically-affiliated groups who resist equitable change (see for example, Evers, 2021). More recently, the changes proposed for the California Math Framework have been met with similar opposition." Like many big sweeping statements, this last assertion is not backed by a peer-reviewed study. It does not take into account the letter to the BOE signed by over 1,1000 STEM professionals Ð or the valid critiques (still unaddressed) that came from the head of undergraduate math at Stanford, Brian Conrad. It is instead a link to a YouCubed blog post. And here is the most pressing issue. The BOE must reject any references in this current framework that do not hold up under scrutiny.

1	"Please see attached comments. Patrick Callahan and I support the adoption of the framework but believe that some editing needs to be done to make sure that the treatment of functions and modeling is comparable in the traditional and integrated pathways. Dear SBE members: The current version of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Schools represents a significant improvement over the previous draft, and we support its adoption. We do, however, wish to note one point that needs attention. Chapter 8 of the Framework sets forth two primary pathways through the secondary mathematics curriculum: the traditional and the integrated pathways. Given that both pathways are intended to address the same content and practices (those delineated in the Common Core), we expected to see closely parallel descriptions of the mathematical content to be covered in the two approaches. This was not the case regarding perhaps the most fundamental concept in mathematics, the concept of function, including the use of functions in mathematical modeling. Discrepancies can be seen easily by looking at Figures 8.5 and 8.8, describing the traditional pathway, as compared to Figures 8.13 and 8.16, describing the integrated pathway. In both pathways we find "modeling with functions" and some structural investigations (e.g., "systems of equations") Ð but, in Figures 8.13 and 8.16 we also find "comparing models," "function representations," "functions in the world," and "equations to predict and model." As we see it, the Framework's description of the integrated pathway provides a much richer Ð and more appropriate, given our understanding of the Common Core Ð description of the ways in which students should encounter functions and modeling. The description of functions and modeling in the traditional pathway should be comparably rich. In what follows we suggest a few ways in which this difference can be addressed. ¥ Early in the chapter, it might be good to stress the central role of functions and modeling across the entire secondary curriculum. This might be done by adding text like the following after line 130: One fundamental use of mathematics is to model real-world situations, for example the costs of different cellphone plans, the changing values of used cars, or the different sizes and comparative costs of different pizzas. What all these situations have in common is that the objects and relationships between them can be expressed in mathematical terms, often with one such object being expressible as a function of another. Once a situation has been described in that way, it can be analyzed mathematically to discover relationships, find patterns, and make predictions. As students progress through the secondary curriculum, they encounter increasingly complex mathematical functions and relationships, and increasingly sophisticated ways to represent and analyze data. They begin by working with linear functions, sets of linear functions, and some polynomial families of functions (for example quadratics). Later on they encounter logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric functions. The mathematical objects or analytic methods they encounter may be new Ð but the processes of mathematizing and sensemaking are the same. It's like writing essays using a larger vocabulary and with an improved capacity for making complex arguments. The goal, whether for applications or the study of mathematical objects and relations in their own right, is to develop robust understandings and habits of sensemaking, with an increasingly large toolkit of concepts and functions. ¥ There is also room for expansion in the brief description of Algebra I in lines 944-952. At minimum, the opening sentence beginning on line 944 can be expanded to say "The main purpose of Algebra I is to develop students' understanding of and fluency with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, and their use to model real-world phenomena." (The words in italics are additions.) ¥ Might it be possible to expand Figures 8.5 and 8.8 to include some of the key ideas in Figures 8.13 and 8.16? ¥¥ In addition, we note that the big ideas for geometry fail to include deductive reasoning. That is, formalizing and proof are presented as good in themselves. In fact, the fundamental goal is reasoning Ð in the early NCTM Standards they were conjoined as reasoning and proof. It would be good to have a statement somewhere along the following lines: "Producing a proof should not be seen as a way to meet abstract requirements regarding the ways that mathematical claims should be presented, but rather as the end product of reasoning and sensemaking, organized and presented in ways that make it easier to convey the resulting understandings."

1	"Board of Education I fully support and endorse the ambitious vision of this proposed framework. I urge you to adopt and support its implementation. As mathematics lesson study participants, we have had the opportunity to apply much of the research-based pedagogy stated in the draft Mathematics Framework which has resulted in continuously seeing students change from non-participants in mathematics classes to becoming mathematics thinkers and doers. From this sample of CA classrooms and their existence proof, I am very much encouraged that progress can be made. To implement this framework system wide will take time, continuous professional learning, as well as ongoing communication with the community. I appreciate the framework highlighting data science since it is integral to making sense of the jobs we do, citizenship responsibilities, medical decisions, climate science, etc. It is essential for students to understand that data and statistics impact every aspect of our lives. Understanding, critiquing, and applying data science is essential if we are going to make reasoned decisions about improvements. I would hope that educators can use data science as we transition to using the ideas embedded in this framework to analyze our progress and inquiries into implementation efforts understanding there will be strengths and weaknesses in our efforts. I am hopeful for teachers and students in our state that we will have the opportunity to leverage this framework to craft meaningful mathematics learning for our students and ourselves. The CA Board of Education and writing teams should be commended for articulating this complex vision of mathematics instruction and their investment in improving learning opportunities for each and every California student.

-1	"I strongly oppose to the proposed California Math Framework. I have been teaching math in California for 41 years and have a degree in mathematics. I have carefully studied the proposed framework. It steers teachers away from using clear direct instruction and from requiring their students to master math facts and algorithms at the right stages of their mathematical development. For example, students who do not memorize their times tables by the end of 3rd grade typically struggle when they try to learn fractions in 4th grade, or decimals in 5th grade, etc. The Framework is opposed to the Common Core Standards on this point -- yet the Framework is intended to help teachers implement the Common Core Standards. The proposed framework will be particularly harmful to students whose families do not have the resources to pay for private math tutors or after-school classes to supplement their math education. Affluent families will be better positioned to seek outside help for their children to succeed in middle and high school math and prepare for STEM careers. This will widen the existing achievement gap even further. There is no legitimate research to back up the claims of the Framework which in many cases defy common sense. Instead, the claims are supported by blog posts by one of the authors or by small scale studies with falsified data (none of it peer-reviewed). It has been clearly established that the claimed success of San Francisco's de-tracking experiment was actually based on false claims (or math errors). Please reject this proposed Mathematics Framework. California's children deserve much better.  " 
1	"The revised 2023 Framework is an excellent step in the right direction and will help secure a strong foundation for students in mathematics. The foundation is critical in giving all students an opportunity for success where as past Frameworks have isolated students and divided them in a top down approach. The revised Framework gives a much clearer direction for districts to follow as well as curriculum developers that have continued to use past standards in their pedagogy in order to market their product. The new Framework will hold teachers more accountable and enforce a needed change in instructional practices in order to compete with other countries that continue to surpass our students in achievement. Common Core was never really implemented and the new Framework will stabilize the message that we are moving forward and not backward. It's time we all get on the same page and stop looking at the past as we already know where that will lead.  "

-1	"REJECT CMF 3.0. Heterogeneously leveled classes are a disaster, speaking from experience. The CMF places all students from a particular grade in the same class, thus superficially eliminating the appearance of disparities. My child has lived through these delaned classes in middle school. This one size fits all classroom, with complex problems that have minimal reinforcement of each student's individual instructional needs, and it does not serve any of the students. Complex word problems are hard for non-native speakers to understand and find math concepts. Struggling students don't get the extra practice and close attention they need because only a fraction of the problem is relevant to them. Students who have mastered the material are frustrated because they cannot progress to their full potential. The excuse I was repeatedly given for making my child repeat material she has already mastered in these classrooms is that she would have "deeper" learning but I have spent many years looking in the scientific literature and have found NO operational definition of the concept or demonstration that heterogeneous classes geared at lower level instruction help students. Instead, parents of these advanced students who have means pay for external classes and tutors during middle school to overcome this problem. In high school, those without financial means that have not had this enrichment and can't compete and likely receive lower grades and grades determine whether they have a chance at these highly competitive engineering programs. The Palo Alto district they tried to enforce this delaning in high school. To accomplish this they violated the California Math Placement Act by forcing most students into the same Geometry class as high school freshmen (they made it a graduation requirement) regardless of whether they already took the class. They refused to perform testing to evaluate whether this class would benefit the student (this was the legal violation). Struggling students complained about having stronger students in their class because this caused them stress and was unfair competition. Encouraging economically disadvantaged students that receive lower grades to take "data science" instead of calculus sabotages their chances of a STEM college degree. The San Francisco public school model of delaying Algebra 1 until high school made reaching calculus impossible without paying for external classes, thus destroying any chance at equity for economically disadvantaged students. Blocking access to calculus makes being accepted to college engineering virtually impossible. Even if these students were allowed into these programs, covering advanced math in high school saves STEM-aspiring, economically disadvantaged students college tuition for those same courses. And still worse, entering a STEM college program without adequate preparation makes disadvantaged students vulnerable to being "weeded out" and left with high tuition debts.  "

" -1	"Public Comment #2 on TFR: Kathryn Jordan kjordan114wh@gmail.com Should injecting ideology take precedence over academic outcomes in the California Math Framework (CMF)? Please reject the CMF Third Field Review (TFR) and retain the 2013 CMF. The CMF's Third Field Review begins by discussing CA students' poor math proficiency, and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation of its ideological and pedagogical proposals, ignoring that its proposals may actually make student proficiency worse. The same TFR proposals made student proficiency worse at SFUSD, where detracking and equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014. SFUSD's math program, the TFR's mirror image, has led to decreased student math proficiency and increased inequity. (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19; see SFUSD at The Research Doesn't Add Up at savemath.net [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://savemath.net__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YOmEJUwUvcqnNtVJ6Sup8pppR5AKIhu1YmmwTeeUdnTgvQxhtvrQEQ3edD0091YZmF0LIOGFXJoV_OTm3gg9B2Wb$], see FFSF Inequity in Numbers report, see ÔPut Algebra 1 back in 8th Grade', Ridgeway, Margulies) Now that the failure of SFUSD's math program is known, it isn't mentioned in the TFR, though SFUSD did figure prominently in the CMF's First Field Review (FFR). By avoiding mention of SFUSD, the TFR avoids drawing attention to the failure of its own proposals. This tactic isn't surprising, as the TFR continues to propose implementing these same failed proposals for all of CA's almost 6 million public school children. Even the evidence the TFR does put forward to support its signature detracking proposal, from which so many of its other proposals stem, is compromised. The key supporting study in the TFR, known as ÔThe Railside Study,' has been heavily critiqued and some would say, discredited. Further, its lead author, a writer of the CMF, hasn't responded to requests to share data, to permit independent verification of its results. Another key detracking paper cited in the TFR, ÔRaising Expectations...' 2021, is an unpublished, non peer reviewed, scantily detailed paper, which one commentator called Ôa blog post' (see @mikeandallie tweets). The one study the TFR cites that shows detracking student benefit, is misrepresented, by shading discussion of the study's findings to emphasize just the detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention, presumably because it is a study of 8th grade Algebra acceleration for all, which the TFR discourages. ÔThe Railside Study' and the ÔRaising Expectations..." papers claim that detracking leads to student academic benefit, but neither can reliably support that conclusion. SFUSD's results certainly do not support it. Detracking is the core TFR go-to proposal, from which other proposals stem, such as heterogeneous (differing student math level) classrooms (through 10th grade), the use of Ôbig ideas' and Ôrich' Ôopen' math tasks to permit multiple entry level points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels, and the use of ÔComplex Instruction', to manage interactions in the heterogeneous classroom. None of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student academic outcomes. In any case, SFUSD has already implemented all of these proposals as a package, and the result was decreased student math proficiency (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19), and increased inequity (see ÔPut Algebra 1 back in 8th grade', Ridgeway, Margulies). TFR suggests implementing the same proposals statewide. Is it because the TFR's ideological commitment to detracking, 'equity', 'equitable outcomes' takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes? At times, the TFR reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum framework. For example, the TFR says the CMF's goal is Ôequity' (Ch. 1). The TFR's Glossary defines Ôequity' as Ôfairness, not sameness', but Ôfairness' and Ôsameness' aren't similarly defined. The Ôequity' definition points to a paper, Gutierrez (2012) ("Context MattersÉ"), and a rubric within the paper, to explain how achieving equity in math education will occur. The 4 dimension rubric, however, is based on Marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics (see page 20 in "Context MattersÉ" Gutierrez 2012). The TFR text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from Critical Race Theory, like Ôequity', Ôequitable outcomes,' Ôsystemic change,' Ôsystemic issues, Ôexamine inequities,'Ôstructural barriers,' Ôstructural injustices', Ôinstitutional injustices', Ôchallenge the status quo', Ôsocial order', Ôculture of exclusion', Ôinequitable', Ôinequities,' Ôchallenge inequities,' Ôstructural inequities,' Ôsystemic inequities,' Ôhistorically marginalized', and Ôhistorically underrepresented,' all of which are part of the CRT lexicon, and stem from its core tenet of Ôsystemic racism'. CRT's contested ideology, derived from Marxism, can be described as "It (CRT) is a Marxian faith system based on the belief that society is organized by white people for their own benefit through something Critical Race theorists call Ôsystemic racism.'" (James Lindsay, ÔWhat is Critical Race Theory' Critical Race Theory Workshop, Session 1, (8:22 and onward) - https:newdiscourses.com) ÔAwakening a "true" racial consciousness that is aware of this (systemic racism) and that unequivocally rejects it (and whiteness itself as its root) is therefore the chief program of Critical Race Theory.' (James Lindsay, ÔRace Marxism', New Discourses, pg. 13) While Critical Race Theory aims to raise a Ôracial consciousness'; the TFR promoted pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Teaching, aims to raise a Ôcritical consciousness'. According to the Calif Dept. of Education (CDE) (https://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ee/culturalrelevantpedagogy.asp), Culturally Relevant Teaching consists of three components, all of which Ômust be utilized', including supporting a students' Ôcritical consciousness,' which is the ability to recognize and critique societal inequalities. The term, ÔCritical consciousness', comes from the Brazilian Marxist Paulo Freire, and is designed to create Marxist political activists by engaging in Marxist thought reform (See ÔThe Marxification of Education'). Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) also makes an appearance in the CMF TFR (Ch. 13). Strands of SEL, such as Transformational SEL, and others, also derive from Marxism, according to New Discourses. The TFR also includes elements from Gender Ideology, and a section on ÔTeaching towards Social Justice'; suggesting both should be incorporated into math curriculum and instruction. It's not just the prevalence of these ideologies in a proposed math curriculum that's a problem, it's that the TFR favors ideological proposals known to lead to academic failure. And it's also that these ideologies, if implemented in public school, would contravene a number of state and federal laws and Constitutional provisions. The purpose of a state curriculum framework is to implement state standards, not to inject woke ideologies. Reject the TFR; retain the 2013 CMF. " -1	"Hello, I'm flabbergasted at the lack of research with in the new K-12 Mathematical Framework. Why does it appear as if only Jo Boaler's research was included? As a math teacher for 17 years in a low income school in California this concerns me. I've read and used ideas from both of Boaler's books, some work and some do not. What about research from: https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26 [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!f5JTpg7JVSBv_ejuDW2DyT9-XI6_GFcqaUrCwgyoEqZgjhQlfwBYpNzCUH4xpJSP-c_9NSHtM_IBL54ogWn0yElw$] I was unable to find anything in our new Framework. California leads the United States in number of students taught. This responsibility needs to be taken seriously, and with lots of research, not just one person's research. Please consider putting off the adoption until additional research of good mathematical practices can be included. Thank you, Jeaninne Cavazos  " -1	"Congratulation This plan is going to accomplish many things, but improve the children of California's math skills is not going to be one of them. I wish I could say I read everything completely but with the limited time you allowed to review and over a holiday weekend, I was not able to accomplish that task as I will assumed your release planned to accomplish minimum responses. From what I read, I'm impressed. You took a basic subject such as math and politicized it with solutions that will not only lower mathematical competency but put a larger burden on the system especially those with task of teaching this subject. I would suggest you look at areas where students thrive in Math and attempt to emulate them. Countries such as China and Philippines have excelled in this subject as have the states of Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho. As a California student I was fortunate to be able to perform math functions acceptability. My skill set wasn't the result of me being included or coming from a higher economical background. I was good because I was taught the basic and had to repetitively solve different problems that where presented to me. Like anything, the more I did it the problems, the better myself and the classmates who kept up did. It was a simple concept that will still work today. I don't know how California lost it's way in basic teaching curriculum. I guess the worry now must be pornographic books not being as your offices says "banned" from library. That would be threatening to certain students. I don't know what math skills are going to be gained from teaching equity. Maybe you will have to emphasize division in order to teach equality. Two subjects that separate and devoid from each other. Just like in a casino, I will have to wish the students of California a hardy "Good Luck" with this framework. The odds, just like in a casino are going to be against them. The students will need luck in order to learn math skills with this plan. " -1	"It's beyond disappointing as a parent of two public school students that the state of California would consider moving towards an unproven framework focused on equity as opposed to allowing students to progress at their own rate. This similar approach at SFUSD has been a disaster. If the state wants to see more students leave the system, this is a sure fire way of making that happen. Please do not move forward with the current proposed math framework.  " -1	"Public Comment #2 on TFR: Kathryn Jordan kjordan114wh@gmail.com Should injecting ideology take precedence over academic outcomes in the California Math Framework (CMF)? Please reject the CMF Third Field Review (TFR) and retain the 2013 CMF. The CMF's Third Field Review begins by discussing CA students' poor math proficiency, and then claims that this poor performance demands implementation of its ideological and pedagogical proposals, ignoring that its proposals may actually make student proficiency worse. The same TFR proposals made student proficiency worse at SFUSD, where detracking and equity focused proposals have been implemented since 2014. SFUSD's math program, the TFR's mirror image, has led to decreased student math proficiency and increased inequity. (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19; see SFUSD at The Research Doesn't Add Up at savemath.net [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://savemath.net__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YgX0m9QAluWGh4kX7iGQ1BotEgGwwS03-DBoY1gF2VLWJCFAPFGAN_JPTRGkWMPzKnQ4bKe-rmY58ElnmrGv8v4z$], see FFSF Inequity in Numbers report, see ÔPut Algebra 1 back in 8th Grade', Ridgeway, Margulies) Now that the failure of SFUSD's math program is known, it isn't mentioned in the TFR, though SFUSD did figure prominently in the CMF's First Field Review (FFR). By avoiding mention of SFUSD, the TFR avoids drawing attention to the failure of its own proposals. This tactic isn't surprising, as the TFR continues to propose implementing these same failed proposals for all of CA's almost 6 million public school children. Even the evidence the TFR does put forward to support its signature detracking proposal, from which so many of its other proposals stem, is compromised. The key supporting study in the TFR, known as ÔThe Railside Study,' has been heavily critiqued and some would say, discredited. Further, its lead author, a writer of the CMF, hasn't responded to requests to share data, to permit independent verification of its results. Another key detracking paper cited in the TFR, ÔRaising Expectations...' 2021, is an unpublished, non peer reviewed, scantily detailed paper, which one commentator called Ôa blog post' (see @mikeandallie tweets). The one study the TFR cites that shows detracking student benefit, is misrepresented, by shading discussion of the study's findings to emphasize just the detracking portion of the multifaceted intervention, presumably because it is a study of 8th grade Algebra acceleration for all, which the TFR discourages. ÔThe Railside Study' and the ÔRaising Expectations..." papers claim that detracking leads to student academic benefit, but neither can reliably support that conclusion. SFUSD's results certainly do not support it. Detracking is the core TFR go-to proposal, from which other proposals stem, such as heterogeneous (differing student math level) classrooms (through 10th grade), the use of Ôbig ideas' and Ôrich' Ôopen' math tasks to permit multiple entry level points into math tasks to accommodate the different student levels, and the use of ÔComplex Instruction', to manage interactions in the heterogeneous classroom. None of these proposals cite solid evidence of improved student academic outcomes. In any case, SFUSD has already implemented all of these proposals as a package, and the result was decreased student math proficiency (See SFUSD CAASPP results 2016-17 to 2018-19), and increased inequity (see ÔPut Algebra 1 back in 8th grade', Ridgeway, Margulies). TFR suggests implementing the same proposals statewide. Is it because the TFR's ideological commitment to detracking, 'equity', 'equitable outcomes' takes precedence over bettering student academic outcomes? At times, the TFR reads more like a political tract than a math curriculum framework. For example, the TFR says the CMF's goal is Ôequity' (Ch. 1). The TFR's Glossary defines Ôequity' as Ôfairness, not sameness', but Ôfairness' and Ôsameness' aren't similarly defined. The Ôequity' definition points to a paper, Gutierrez (2012) ("Context MattersÉ"), and a rubric within the paper, to explain how achieving equity in math education will occur. The 4 dimension rubric, however, is based on Marxist ideological concepts of identity and of power dynamics (see page 20 in "Context MattersÉ" Gutierrez 2012). The TFR text is sprinkled throughout with tenets and concepts from Critical Race Theory, like Ôequity', Ôequitable outcomes,' Ôsystemic change,' Ôsystemic issues, Ôexamine inequities,'Ôstructural barriers,' Ôstructural injustices', Ôinstitutional injustices', Ôchallenge the status quo', Ôsocial order', Ôculture of exclusion', Ôinequitable', Ôinequities,' Ôchallenge inequities,' Ôstructural inequities,' Ôsystemic inequities,' Ôhistorically marginalized', and Ôhistorically underrepresented,' all of which are part of the CRT lexicon, and stem from its core tenet of Ôsystemic racism'.

" -1	"The CMF is repeating the failed removal of Phonics Experiment but now with math. Neuroscience showed us that learning phonics is vital and should not be subjugated to social emotional learning. The ultimate irony was a reference in CMF to an fMRI study that compared 15 students with and 15 students without math learning disability that used the CMF 2013 techniques and showed brain activity normalized in students with math learning disabilities. Here is the quote. "One study conducted by neuroscientists in Stanford's School of Medicine examined the effects of a tutoring intervention with students who had been diagnosed as having mathematics "learning disabilities" and those with no identified difficulties in mathematics (Luculano et al., 2015). Prior to the intervention, the group of students with identified "learning disabilities" had lower mathematics performance and different brain activation patterns than students who had no identified difficulties in mathematics. After eight weeks of one-on-one tutoring focused on strengthening student understanding of relationships between and within operations, not only did both sets of students demonstrate comparable achievement, but they also activated the same brain areas (Luculano et al., 2015). Since the brain is always developing in relation to the experiences people are engaged in, well-designed and focused math experiences support the development of pathways in the brain that enable all students to access and engage productively in the content." The tutoring program in this study was described in the appendix of the paper and it extensive and followed the 2013 Framework guidance. The conclusion of the authors was wrong. The authors demonstrated that the two groups differed LESS after the training and there was no evidence of any development of new brain "pathways" in the students with learning disabilities. Furthermore, to claim anything about "all students" on the basis of a tiny group of 15 students with learning disabilities (it is unclear why the term is in quotes, almost as if authors questioned the diagnosis) speaks to the difficulty these writers have in interpreting brain science. They need an expert in brain science to advise them. " 1	"RE: Letter of Support for the 2023 Mathematics Framework Dear President Darling-Hammond and Members of the State Board of Education: I, Ma Bernadette Andres-Salgarino, am writing to express my wholehearted support for the revised Mathematics Framework. As the President-Elect of the CA Mathematics Council, Board Member of TODOS Mathematics for All, and a member of Math CFCC, I am committed to advocating for a high-quality mathematics education that propels the success of ALL students in college, career, and life. The revised Mathematics Framework is a significant step in addressing the urgent need to improve mathematics teaching and learning. It strongly emphasizes equity and excellence, recognizing and celebrating students' diverse backgrounds, genders, races, cultures, religions, and achievements. Furthermore, it outlines clear strategies to ensure that every student receives the necessary support and challenges to thrive in their chosen pathways to success. A key strength of the revised Mathematics Framework is its student-centered approach. It provides comprehensive guidance to educators in establishing a system of support that aligns with rigorous, focused, and coherent standards, as exemplified through the Big Ideas. By centering on students, the framework fosters engagement and ownership of learning, empowering students to become active participants in their mathematical journey. I am particularly enthusiastic about the framework's emphasis on expanding access to joyful and relevant mathematics through Data Science for TK - 12. By equipping students with the knowledge, understanding, and skills to use data as a tool for mathematical reasoning and problem-solving, the revised Mathematics Framework ensures that students are prepared to navigate the increasingly data-driven world. This focus on Data Science will enhance students' critical thinking and analytical abilities, enabling them to make informed decisions and contributions to society. Equally important is the framework's dedication to inclusivity and belonging. It provides strategies to support diverse learners, including Multilingual Learners, students with disabilities, and students from historically marginalized communities. This commitment to inclusivity ensures that all students have equitable access to high-quality mathematics education, fostering a sense of belonging and creating opportunities for success. As a parent and an experienced educator, I implore the State Board of Education to adopt the 2023 Mathematics Framework. This framework empowers students and their families, maximizing opportunities for growth and development. California cannot afford to wait any longer; we must take bold action to propel our children forward and enable them to thrive. For these compelling reasons, I wholeheartedly support the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework. Thank you for your attention on this critical matter. Sincerely, Ma Bernadette Andres-Salgarino President-Elect, California Mathematics Council " -1	"California math curricula should follow common sense approaches to avoid our continuing substandard test results.  " -1	Please see attached. -1	"Ch 12 p4L74" When anxious, the working memoryÑthe part of the brain needed for reproducing mathematics factsÑis compromised." WRONG! Overlearning facts and testing KNOWLEDGE helps! Whereas the 2013 Framework advocated for a MIX of rote learning to support development of fluency and problem-solving in instruction, in this revised Framework there is much discussion about how rote learning is a problem and that assessment and math education must instead focus on testing complex reasoning problems to avoid disadvantaging people with math anxiety. In fact, this is the opposite of what is best for students with high math anxiety. This was demonstrated long ago as the anxiety-to-complexity effect (Faust, Ashcroft, and Fleck, 1996) "The more difficult or complex the arithmetic problem, the more disadvantaged high maths anxious subjects are, in terms of either speed of processing or accuracy". Yes, working memory that supports mental flexibility needed for reasoning problems is vulnerable to distraction and anxiety, but retrieval of facts depends on a different mental process, semantic or declarative memory, not working memory. Reproducing mathematics facts, if heavily overlearned, will likely make student performance MORE resilient against math anxiety during testing. Having a strong "conceptual" representation depends on learning which involves both rehearsal of arbitrary facts as well as learning conceptual relationships. But to dismiss as unimportant an entire approach to learning, notably practice, is as unwise as cutting out part of our brains. Chunking is an example of how our limited capacity, working memory system, benefits from facts. Working memory capacity is typically limited to 5 elements + or Ð 2. Imagine holding in mind a short series of letters one has just heard (a g r z), or repeating those letters in reverse alphabetical order (z r g a). That is working memory. One can vastly expand working memory capacity for holding in mind letters with arbitrary facts of how to spell words linked to knowledge (e.g. if one groups letters into the words apple green red zero-17 letters held in mind!). The same principles are used in other fields. Musicians learn scales and arpeggios they practice to automaticity and these patterns enable them to play more fluently. Baseball pitchers and other ball-sports learn procedures to throw balls a high speeds. Riding a bicycle involves procedural fluency in the mechanics of the device to enable navigation to new places. Similarly, math relies on multiple mental processes that require fluency. If one has to figure out why 2+2=4 then then this process will compete for this limited capacity of working memory. Lack of practice to automaticity for students with math anxiety may indeed lead to those students having trouble retrieving facts but this would instead be due to inadequate instruction. And this situation is what the Framework is advocating.  " 1	Please see attached comments. Thank you. 1	"Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond and the members of the California State Board of Education, California needs to do more to meet the mathematics learning needs of ALL students. This draft Mathematics Framework, when implemented with integrity, will challenge all of us, as it should, to stretch and grow and learn for the benefit of our students and their futures. This Framework communicates we are paying attention to the data and listening to the voices of all students, including our most vulnerable. As a grandparent, retired high school math teacher (from AP Calculus through alternative education), coach for new math teachers and member of the 2013 CA Math Framework Committee, I support the 2023 Revised Draft Mathematics Framework as recommended by the California Department of Education. I urge you to adopt this Framework as presented. I shared my vision for mathematics learning at one of the 2019 Focus Group meetings. I was not alone. The SBE listened to suggestions from myself and others and approved guidelines that address the needs of all students and clarifies and builds upon the previous Framework. Through both public reviews, I continued to share my thoughts, concerns and appreciation as an individual and as a member of caring math educator communities. I signed the California Math Council's letter of support along with hundreds (2800+) of others. Some highlights of this Framework for me, to name a few of many: ¥ Support for all learners ¥ Guiding principles toward equity in mathematics instruction (Ch. 1, p. 11) ¥ Five components of instructional design (Ch. 2, pp. 10- ) ¥ Assets-based approach to instruction (Ch. 2, p. 8) ¥ Support for meaningful mathematics, including cultural and personal relevance (Ch. 2, p. 11) ¥ Emphasis on Big Ideas and coherence across grades (Ch. 1, pp. 15-18, Ch. 2, p. 13) ¥ Designing instruction with integration in mind (Ch. 8, p. 25, 54) ¥ Rigorous pathways in addition to the common pre-calculus/calculus pathway with more choices for third- and fourth-year courses. (Ch. 8, pp. 29-31) ¥ Elevate real-world application of mathematics understanding (Ch. 8, p. 32) ¥ Reasoning with data (Ch. 1, p. 24) The challenge to create an advisory, guiding document that is exactly what all stakeholders desire is an impossible task. This is an excellent document. All of the persons involved in this monumental task of creating this forward-thinking document should be commended for their diligence in following the guidelines approved by the State Board in 2019 and be thanked for their huge investment of time for the benefit of all students.

" -1	"Dear State Board of Education, Firstly, thank you for your hard work and dedication toward improving math achievement for our students. We're on the same team. With that said, I strongly believe the Board should reject the proposed math framework. My three main reasons: 1. Tom Loveless, the accomplished education researcher policy author of 16 volumes of the Brown Center Report on American Education, summarized the main concerns about the framework's severe lack of quality research in his writing here: https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/evidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/evidence-struggling-math-students-and-californias-2022-math-framework__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5zeU3nGcw$] The part that stood out to me the most was: 'The 2022 California Math Framework does not reflect current scholarship on how to serve students who struggle when learning mathematics. A search of studies cited in a recent What Works Clearinghouse publication, "Assisting Students Struggling with Mathematics: Intervention in the Elementary Grades," reveals absolutely no overlap. ... the process employed to search literature and select evidence for the framework's recommendations is unknown.' 2. In January 2022, one of the framework's co-authors, Katy Early, gave a presentation titled 'Teaching to Big Ideas' to our district's elementary staff. One concern was that she distributed an article, which as a district we took time to discuss, that denigrated timed math fluency practice. However, timed math fluency practice has strong evidence, according to the federal What Works Clearinghouses's practice guide on assisting struggling math students (https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26 [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/26__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5yMwYAdtg$]). The article she distributed mentioned anxiety related to timed math fluency practice, but the truth is 'No studies have determined that timed tests cause math anxiety - defined as feelings of apprehension, tension, or fear that may interfere with performance on math-related tasks.(a) In fact, timed tactics improve math performance.(b),' according to the experts at Science of Math group (www.scienceofmath.com [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.scienceofmath.com__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!Yk13jqub00LOG9gnLt0VmdkDotpderhG-XEN9ea0-l3IcVh1Hee336UACS6BQGm7GYmJaavYsowhK5wOycekEw$]). I asked Katy about the research behind the framework and her answer wasn't much beyond 'it's got research behind it.' The result was some of our staff were convinced we should not have math fact expectations or timed fluency practice anymore. This is sad and frustrating and bad for our kids. The framework wields immediate influence to the detriment of our students. 3. My final reason is presented as a set of questions for decision-makers such as yourself, and these come from Amanda VanDerHeyden, who is part of the Science of Math group: What do university mathematics professors think of the revised framework (not math ed professors, but mathematics and more broadly, STEM professors)? What evidence do you have from well-controlled experimental studies that these revisions will produce benefits to students? Where are the field trials that have been through peer-review and show benefit? What are the measured costs or side-effects? What are the effects on learning for students from various backgrounds and starting skill levels? What are the operationalized training models that will equip teachers to deliver the new framework with sufficient integrity? What evidence can you show from rigorous research studies demonstrating that your manualized training systems will equip teachers to implement? Who advised changing both the instructional scheme (your independent variable) and your measurement scheme (your dependent variables and measures) at the same time? This is basic science 101 and doing this means that CA students' rights are not being protected. What is the alignment of the instruction (targets, methods) and assessments proposed in the new framework with the last 30 years of policy guidance and funded federal research (e.g., the IES practice guides in mathematics that summarize research evidence, national panels)? Where are the voices & citations of the well-regarded substantive researchers in mathematical learning from all branches of psychology, from mathematics, from special education? Thank you for your time in reading this.  " -1	"After reading the proposed framework I am vehemently opposed and recommend a full reassessment of the state's approach to mathematics education. In this Draft we find no measurable goals or performance indicators, nothing pertaining to actually mathematics education or approaches to learning, and a deep lack of rigor in anything one would call academic. Instead we are drenched with inclusive language that, while may feel like a fair and respectful way to educate, does not apply to math nor serves our student body. Do not approve this. I repeat do not approve this. Our state has woefully low maths comprehension and we owe it to our students to provide a foundation of true understanding in this subject. It's embarrassing that this document was produced by a group tasked with improving the educational frameworks of our state. I repeat, DO NOT APPROVE.  " 1	"As the president of the Orange County Mathematics Council and a STEM coordinator for 23 CA elementary schools, I am writing to you to share my support for the adoption of the 2023 CA math framework. The focus on equity and anti-tracking is of particular importance. In fact, every professional development conference I have been to in the last few years, whether locally, or at the state or even national level, has focused on the issue of equity in math education. Not only do many of our CA students need equitable math instruction and opportunities to succeed, but they deserve it. As educators, we must meet the needs of our changing population, of every single one of our students, and this framework sets teachers up to do exactly that. In addition, I had the honor of being a part of the framework committee for the state. As those who were in the room for the discussions know, the educators involved in this process were knowledgeable, highly respected in the field of math education, and advocates for students of all races achieving at every level. The process was sound and the words in the framework agreed upon. We have known without a doubt that this framework would improve student experiences, increase learning, and set students up for a successful future as critical thinkers. Please, with all of our CA students in mind, approve the math framework for our state. If we want more of our children to succeed, this is the guiding document that can allow that achievement to happen. Thank you.  " -1	"This is the wrong approach for math. California students are struggling in math and this is not going to help, but will actually push them backward farther. There are excellent math textbooks and teachers in California at The Art of Problem Solving. Every student should learn math the way AOPS presents it. We'd have the best math scores in the nation if we took that approach and not this new approach concocted by people out of touch with what actual student needs.  " 1	"I am writing to support the inclusion of Chapter 5: Mathematical Foundations for Data Science. A growing evidence base suggests significant value for K-12 data science programs and their positive impact on students trajectories. While these programs may appear new, they build upon a strong foundation of education research and learning science literature stretching back over a decade. Between 2013 and 2018, National Science Foundation grants supported the development of high school data science courses, curricula, and K-12 classroom software. Today, over 70+ classroom resources are available for K-12 data science education. In 2019, an international consortium of researchers published the IDSSP Framework http://www.idssp.org/ [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.idssp.org/__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!fez0eY781XaWo6XLag1nleyaWKEpO2B-QpIPbqFnWG_ZpMR2F0IPUpBP2W-xIahlb-EUQsO13HXxRKf56bo7CJjB$], forwarding a common framework for stand-alone high school courses across countries. In 2021, the Institute of Education Sciences released a Technical Working Group for K-12 data science education, that highlighted significant opportunities for student engagement, greater diversity in STEM education, and additional research opportunities to forward the field. In my capacity as a former researcher for the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (IES), I helped to gather evidence and diverse research expertise for this report, all which demonstrated significant potential value for students' mathematics learning if scaled. In 2022, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released their first national proceedings that cataloged a diverse array of K-12 data science programs around the country. The report and commissioned papers highlighted the uniquely strong student engagement, positive identity formation, and rigorous mathematical thinking that students gain from diverse curriculum programs around the country Ð gathered through over 60 field-submitted case-studies, educator interviews, and 6 expert panel discussions over two days. I am writing to share an additional research evaluation on high school data science course programs in California (attached) that show relative gains for student attitudes toward mathematics, interest in STEM, confidence in STEM skills, and greater math course-taking when given the opportunity to enroll in a high school data science course. This study is pre-publication and still subject to peer review, but we are sharing now given the forthcoming framework decision deadline. We believe this is yet another indication among many that K-12 data science programs have strong potential to bring students into STEM pathways who would not otherwise consider these options Ð providing students the motivation to learn additional mathematics in high school and higher education that is required for STEM degree programs. The revised Framework is a first step toward building content equity in ensuring students have access to a variety of advanced, 21st century mathematics options.

Must be intentional to avoid feedback. California should look at states with the highest scores in math to implement a new program. There needs to be much more drilling and repetition in our math programs like there used to be. Here we go againÉthe main focus is equityÉthere is no way to measure success? Equity only deals with fairness. It should be samenessÉthere is only one correct answer for a math problem. Kids don't have to be focused on student identity developmentÉwe should just be teaching math!! Math is a non political subject and it seems the state is making it one.

That is not promoting all students to be proficient in math. That is promoting no students being proficient. While this reduces our students viability in college and the workplace it also reduces their ability to be successful in life. Our own colleges will be skipping over our students for ones from other states who are qualified. If students do go to college with this type of education they will drop out. We already have a high number of students that do not finish college because they were not prepared. The solution is not to under prepare thwm even more. There is a mass exodus out of California and it will get bigger if this plan passes. Then you will not even have enough students in some areas to keep schools open. You need to scrap this plan and look at other states that are leading the way in this field and do that. The farther behind our students fall equals the farther behind our state falls. Vote no! " -1	"It's concerning that this new framework relies heavily on inaccurate, disputed data. Reputable leaders in the math profession like Prof. Jelani Nelson at UCB and many others have pointed out the flaws with the data and framework - ironically the new framework uses apples/orange comparisons to attempt to show better educational outcomes. When probed with accurate review of the data, the principles of the framework actually worsened student outcomes. The goal of improving math literacy will not be met with this framework. Rejecting is in the best interest of CA students.  " -1	"The California Math Framework was written by curriculum developers who stand to financially benefit from being included. For example it promotes the youcubed curriculumÉ which was created by Jo Boaler, one of the original authors of the CMFÉ and which has never been evaluated in a peer-reviewed study. This is a blatant conflict of interest. Even worse, the Framework lets districts deny bright kids the opportunity to take algebra in 8th grade Ñ which is a standard option most places on the planet. In SF, removing 8th grade algebra led to privileged parents finding workarounds or leaving public schoolsÉ while kids with no options fell behind their peers in neighboring districts. And the performance of Black and Latino kids hasn't materially improved Ñ in fact, the performance gap has widened. It has taken 10 years of advocacy to get the policy reversed (still working on it), and that's thousands of schoolchildren we left behind. Please don't let other districts make our mistake. Every 8th grader should have access to algebra, if they're ready for it. Thank you. " 1	"Adopt National Teachers of Mathematics standards k-12.

This math pathway diagram fails STEM students because it places significant roadblocks and obstacles in the path of students hoping to reach AP Calculus in high school. The above article describes that in the end this especially harms students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds because these students rely solely on the public school for education. If the public school system does not offer opportunities to students, they do not get them. Families with resources can find alternatives outside the public school system leaving families without resources behind. For this reason, as warned by STEM professionals in an Open Letter, this could "lead to a de facto privatization of advanced mathematics K-12 education and disproportionately harm students with fewer resources." Why would we guide California to adopt the policies that fail STEM students and especially harm students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds? This Framework must be rejected. " -1	"The Framework should be rejected because it is guiding districts to adopt policies of a district that has demonstrably failed its students.

This figure, which represents the math course diagram the Framework is guiding for California, places the taking of Algebra I or Mathematics I in 9th grade, and with a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience", this means for all students. This math course pathway diagram is essentially the same as San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD). Both of these policies are already occurring at SFUSD, which also has as its basis a policy which delays Algebra I until 9th grade for all students, just as the Framework guides for. This is well known to the writers of the Framework as they explicitly referenced SFUSD in their first draft, but removed mention of it in the subsequent drafts after it was pointed to them that the success claims of SFUSD were misrepresented. Disregarding this, although mention of SFUSD was removed with regard to the math pathway diagram, it is clear that the math pathway diagram recommended by the Framework is substantially similar to that of SFUSD, as shown in the attachment, both the Framework and SFUSD have only one path for students before 11th grade and delay Algebra I until 9th grade for all students.

He was able to complete all community college math classes by the end of high school. This gave him an opportunity to take upper level math classes in college and transfer enough credits to be able to get the BS I'm physics in three years while saving on tuition. I hate to think that kids who love math will not have this opportunity.  " -1	"The new proposed math framework is an abomination. Just teach math. My daughter will not be enrolling her 4 year old daughter in public school, since everything 'taught' there is so politicized. I agree with everything Palos verdes Peninsula School Board Member, Julie Hamill said below: f I were in charge of creating a new math framework, I would look to places where children are excelling in math and borrow their strategies. Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho have the highest NAEP scores in Math. First generation Chinese immigrants in our community explained to me the drilling and repetition they learned in school, and wonder why we cannot implement the same here Ð because it works. Instead, California's proposed framework is heavy on critical theory and political buzzwords, light on actual math. It reads like an instructional manual on social justice Ð not how to teach math. While this may appeal to those who identify with the far left, it repels everyone else, and FAILS THE GOAL OF ACTUALLY TEACHING MATH. The stated focus is equity Ð for which there are no measurable objective benchmarks. In fact, I did not find anything in the framework regarding how to measure success. The framework defines equity as: "fairness in education rather than sameness....equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power." First of all - sameness is important in math. There is only one correct answer to a mathematical problem. That is how math works. Secondly - Do kids really need to be focused on student identity development in math, or attention to relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is objectively insane to me. From the overview: "The goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldÑin their careers, in college, and in civic life." From Chapter 1: "Reflecting the state's commitment to equity, every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all." Equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2, 9 and 10. The framework is also focused on "environmental literacy" Ð which has nothing to do with learning math. In summary, the horse is out of the barn on this framework and I don't think anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. They are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas. My recommendation would be to completely scrap this framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful Ð like those in Massachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters. Instead, our government has taken a non-political subject Ð MATH Ð heavily politicized it and turned it into a critical theory vessel for "equity" Ð whatever that means.

I agree that students' benefit from opportunities to explicitly connect conceptual understanding with facts and procedures in ways that make sense to them. It is crucial for educators to encourage mathematical growth in students so that they can persevere in learning beginning arithmetic and computation and advance to abstract subjects in algebra and geometry. We need this framework to help classroom teachers deliver both basic concepts and math fact instruction and prepare our students to succeed in higher levels of mathematics. Thank you.

However, I am disappointed that the framework still does not support a pathway to algebra in 8th grade. 'Appendix A: Mathematical Progressions within the High School Pathways' clearly places algebra in 9th grade. However, it is imperative to get to Calculus A prior to college for physics, math, or engineering majors, which requires either algebra in 9th grade our doubling up on math in high school. I majored in physics in college and those students that had not had calculus prior to college had major problems. Thank you. " -1	"This is not math. This is offensive.

In particular, I do not support weakening the requirement that third graders master multiplication. Multiplication accuracy must be continuously stressed in 3rd grade, or else students will not be ready for division, fractions, and decimals in 4th and 5th grades. Automaticity in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is vital for understanding pre-algebra and pre-geometry. You cannot skip the 4 operations which are the building blocks of math. Permitting young students to use calculators during math in elementary or middle school is the essence of irresponsibility. Also, 8th grade Algebra should be offered in every middle school. Without 8th grade Algebra, students cannot take Calculus in 12th grade without workarounds such as summer school, doubling up, etc. This is not fair to students who are ready to take Algebra by 8th grade. There should be high dosage tutoring offered at every CA public school during regular school hours so that C- or worse students who fall behind have help. It should be mandatory. Don't let students fall s-o-o far behind. Do not water down math standards!! Is it Equity when high school students graduate without a firm grasp of arithmetic or Algebra 1? Is it Equity when they must take Remedial Math at Community College (which includes arithmetic and Algebra 1)? Is it Equity when STEM careers are closed to them because they never mastered arithmetic/Algebra 1? " -1	"The Framework should be rejected because the policies it is recommending California adopt violate education codes. The Framework recommends in Chapter 8 line 701 "Figure 8.4 below indicates possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." Education codes EDC 51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5 clearly articulate that: 1) 9th grade math course placement is recognized as being very important in the careers of students. 2) It is expected that the math course placement of one student will differ from the next. This is obvious because, if it was not, then there would be no need for a "Math Placement Act". If a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" was expected, there would be no need to be concerned with placing students in different classes. There would be no need for a "Math Placement Act" as students would all be having a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" and be placed in the same class. That is, there would be no need to place students in different classes. The law dictates students should be placed in different classes based on their proficiency and have an experience substantially different than some other students, and specifically, as dictated by law, not a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience". 3) Fair and objective testing is required by law to be used to determine which course the student is to be properly placed in. This means it is expected that the placement of one student will be different from the next, and a student is allowed to demonstrate which class he/she is to be properly placed in by performance on a test, among other methods. This makes it illegal for districts to place all students in the same class which would be to impose a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" on its students . Since this Framework is guiding districts to impose an ILLEGAL policy on its students, the Framework must either: 1) CLEARLY explain to districts that this is illegal. 2) Excise from the Framework the parts of the Framework that guide districts towards this ILLEGAL policy, that is remove the phrase a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" and all guidance associated with it. 3) Not adopt the Framework. The State Board of Education must vote to not adopt the Framework. Since the illegality of this wording in the Framework has been present in all three drafts, and this has been clearly pointed out to the writers of the Framework in Public Comment, it is clear that this wording is both the intention of the Framework writers and that they continue to write this disregarding the knowledge of its illegality. This shows complete and utter negligence on the part of the Framework writers, a dereliction of duty, and therefore the best solution is for the Framework to not be adopted and for the writing of the Framework be started over from scratch by a group of writers that are willing to not guide districts to invoke policies that break the law.

" -1	"Equity does not mean uniformity. Equity means equal access and support for all. There are people who will write more eloquently than I have time to do given the short window created for public response to this overhaul of California mathematics. But I want to be clear- we used the BIG IDEAS textbooks in my children's middle school this past year, and the students fell so far behind peers in other schools using more traditional textbooks that the our children began panicking. All were forced to use on line platforms to teach themselves the material at home in their limited free time. Using their precious free time (which should be dedicated to extra curriculars, family, homework or relaxation) to learn the basics of geometry given that the BIG IDEAS textbook was so remedial, repetitive and insufficient. The new framework is not based on data driven research. It has been uniformly criticized by experts in mathematics and teachers. I dedicate my volunteer hours to increase equity and access for TSP students in accelerated gifted pathways. We need to improve very early education and gifted identification. We need to allow our accelerated learners - from all economic, cultural and racial backgrounds- to have the support and encouragement they need in order to fulfill their potential. The problems we face as a world are going to require great minds with advanced educations. We need stem innovators, we need students who are radically, accelerated in mathematics and all sciences. Our planet is broken and we need to build a generation of thinkers inventors and creators. We cannot do that by believing that equity equals uniformity. We must allow athletes to succeed in athletics, just as we allow mathematicians to succeed in mathematics. We don't cripple our fastest runners and it is undathomable to me that we celebrate a gymnastics prodigy but want to bridle and restrain a math whiz. This is anti intellectualism at its worst and most insidious. I'm sure you are aware mathematicians do their greatest work in their 20s and early 30s. We cannot hobble our youth by preventing them from accelerating in math if that is something that they are willing interested and able to do. We will drive our brightest into the private school sector. Furthermore, we will radicalized parents and send them to the far right. We are already seeing the catastrophic affects of the radical right in much of California. However, initiatives like the California math framework will push moderates to the right. Sadly, only the right seems to be their ally in this argument, and that is devastating. It will have a ripple effect into politics as well. All because California is taking the advice of a woman who should not only not be listened to, but who should be criticized and dismissed for her lack of ethics in misrepresenting data and parading opinion as fact. Will we stop young children from reading novels if they are inclined to do so? This is seeming very "brave new world" to me. The new math framework is an embarrassment to California. We are already lagging many behind many other countries in stem. This new framework will aggravate the problem. The fact that you are listening to the advice of someone who seems to be inclined to be promoting her own textbooks and op-eds instead of listening to the hundreds of mathematicians and stem professionals telling you that this is bad research is deeply troubling to me. Acceleration works. That fact is backed up by research across the board. Tracking may or may not always work, but radical acceleration produces PhDÔs. It produces patents. It produces scientists. This is proven. Denying acceleration to gifted children destroys their passion for education and it is cruel. We need to offer the opportunity to accelerate to all of our students. And we need to improve math education for those who are not accelerated. Most students don't need calculus. Perhaps we need to rethink that. But we certainly need many of our students to learn calculus in order to succeed in fields that require it. And if those students want to learn calculus in fourth grade 8th grade 10th gradeÑTerrific. We need those kids; they're going to fix the world.

Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! v. Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 10 _ An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? Textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed, so what isn't the CMF held to the SAME standard?. _ To be eligible for adoption, programs must include a well-defined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards (Ch 13 line 239) 11 _ Materials that fail to meet all of the criteria in category 1 (Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards) will not be considered suitable for adoption. (Ch 13 line 246) _ Instructional materials, as defined in EC Section 60010(h), must be aligned to the CA CCSSM Content Standards and SMPs, adopted by the SBE in August 2010 and modified in January 2013. (Ch 13 line 257) 4. The CMF is more concerned with developing students' positive math identities and making sure they are "engaged" during class than it is with ensuring students master math content standards. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. _ A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) 12 _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) 13 I want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. To that end I teach (and model for) student teachers and inservice teachers how to establish a healthy classroom culture. That said, it is one piece of good math instruction, not the primary goal. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. _ In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! _ In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? 14 5. The advice given on "acceleration" is unclear and based on false pretenses. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). _ Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration 15 based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a 16 program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to 17 master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected. Conclusion If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black, Brown and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged students (for whom most of my work focuses on helping) will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54) The majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students, regardless of their skin color; in mathematics, this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards. What does the CMF suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups? Does the CMF devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students? Unfortunately, the CMF is instead focused on ensuring these students have "authentic experiences" and that teachers "center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics." (Ch 2 line 513) This is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer; who thinks that will help? Everyone knows you get better at soccer (and in our case, math) by learning and practicing. Rather than assume our struggling students need some type of "show" to help them learn, let's support them (and all CA students) to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the CAASPP. 18 SBE- please reject this framework and only adopt one based upon the CA math content standards that has BALANCED instruction and places math proficiency (as measured by CAASPP) as the primary focus. Please only adopt a framework that correctly proportions the focus on student feelings about math and authentic tasks with a focus on standards-based conceptual development and procedural fluency. If a CMF discusses options to accelerate, require clear language and give multiple options for students to choose to join or leave the accelerated pathway, beginning in grade 7. Keep the completion of Algebra II/ Integrated Math III as the goal for all students. Please only adopt a framework that focuses on mathematics and evidenced-based ways to help more students become proficient in math, as this is how equity will be achieved." -1	All this does is put private schooled kids at an advantage. -1	"Lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students).

So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"I understand and share your concerns as a concerned parent, citizen, and 3rd generation resident of California. The proposed math framework, unfortunately, falls short in its objectives, serving political interests rather than prioritizing the excellence in math education that our children deserve. It is crucial that we steer ourselves towards quantifiable goals, such as the NAEP math assessments, which provide a reliable benchmark for measuring student proficiency. We should strive to achieve scores that meet or exceed results from kids in Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho. Regrettably, the current framework lacks the necessary clarity and foresight. I implore you to reconsider and adopt an alternative framework that places a strong emphasis on objectivity and measurable outcomes. Our primary goal should be to teach math in its purest form, devoid of any political influences. By doing so, we can provide our children with a well-rounded education that equips them for a future filled with opportunities. Kids deserve a rigorous, flexible math curriculum that empowers them to excel, think critically, and develop essential problem-solving skills through consistent, routine practice.

While I recognize that the guidelines provided to the committee do not prioritize providing all students the best mathematical foundation possible, I strongly believe that our educational policies should strive for this goal. This approach could have been balanced with a healthy dose of skepticism towards the referenced research and a commitment to scientific rigor. Thank you for considering my comments.

" -1	A Focus on Social Justice is replacing a focus on mastering math -1	"The CMF is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." -1	"Just hoping for a common sense math framework that uses the best available scientific evidence, is authored by members free of commercial/financial bias, and acknowledges gaps in the evidence base while trying to center on the needs of our kids. I don't think this current framework meets any of those three criteria. " 1	"Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond and the members of the California State Board of Education, The leadership of the California Mathematics Council (CMC) has crafted and attached our letter of support for the Revised 2023 California Mathematics Framework. We have been actively involved throughout the development of the draft Mathematics Framework beginning with the providing of input at the 2019 Focus Group meetings. Several of our CMC leaders served as valuable members of the CFCC and we continued to provide extensive feedback through both rounds of public comment. In addition, CMC wrote a letter of support co-signed by over 2800 individuals and over 60 organizations. As stated in the attached letter, we recommend the CA SBE adopt the Revised 2023 California Mathematics Framework as posted on June 26, 2023. Respectfully, Bruce C. Grip, President California Mathematics Council Dear Members of the State Board of Education, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools (Mathematics Framework). This letter is signed by several of California's educational advocacy and research organizations, who have been working together for over two years to ensure that the Framework includes principles of equity and strategies to meet the needs of California's diverse student population. We believe that the updated Framework is asset-based and, if implemented properly, can help to close opportunity gaps in math instruction. We are also pleased to see the focus on equity in pedagogical approaches to teaching math still included from the previous version. Therefore, we write in support of approving the 2023 Mathematics Framework, with a modification to Chapter 13 that would ensure that instructional materials are aligned to English language development (ELD) standards. We thank the writers, staff, and members of the Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education for incorporating many of the comments members of this coalition have provided over the past two years. The updated Framework offers a strong vision for math instruction that is focused on deeper learning and on ensuring there is clear support and equitable access to rigorous coursework for all students. In particular, we appreciate the following areas the Framework emphasizes: _ Culturally Relevant and Asset-Based. The Framework offers strategies and vignettes that can make math culturally relevant to students of color and multilingual students. These include strategies for drawing on students' experiences, elevating the assets of linguistically diverse students and families, and incorporating families in math learning. The vignettes also highlight the diversity of students and offer examples of how educators can meet the needs of students with diverse learning needs. _ Supporting English Learners. The Framework offers guidance on supporting English learners and leveraging the language assets of students. We support references to the English Language Arts/ELD Framework, ELD standards, strategies and scaffolds to support English learners (ELs), and assessment considerations. However, there is still an area of opportunity to add language to Chapter 13, Category 1: Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards (lines 251-275), that would make alignment to ELD standards a key feature for instructional materials (please see letter submitted on June 6 that discusses this recommendation in more detail). Understanding that a Framework serves as guidance to the field, we also emphasize the following areas of focus moving forward that would ensure the promise within the Framework is achieved. _ Opportunity to Provide High Quality Instructional Materials. LEAs still need additional guidance and support for ensuring they adopt high quality instructional materials. Therefore, we hope that guidance from the Framework can be elaborated on and additional support provided to support LEAs in their adoption process. It is our hope that within the state adoption process the selected reviewers come with various areas of expertise in meeting the needs of our highest-need students, including English learners, students with disabilities, and students of color. Similar guidance about the areas of expertise that LEAs should include in their review processes should also be provided to the field. Tools and resources that can help meet the needs of high-need students should also be incorporated within the state and LEA adoption processes. For example, there are rubrics and tools available that should be incorporated, such as Criteria for Review of Instructional Materials' Success in Addressing MLL Linguistic and Instructional Needs, which was recently published by the California Curriculum Collaborative. _ Support for Implementation. While the Framework remains long, it does include many evidence-based instructional practices that can benefit LEAs, schools, and educators. Therefore, we hope that the state provides additional resources and supports to ensure the rich guidance in the Framework reaches the field and multiple audiences, including LEA leaders, educators, and families. These supports can include professional learning opportunities, tools, and resources. County offices of education must also play an important role in providing regional support and guidance to ensure equitable implementation. Key areas to consider are: 1) professional learning related to high-leverage instructional strategies, 2) support for districts in reviewing and updating policies around enrollment in rigorous math coursework, and 3) systems that provide equitable access for all students. Without support from the state and county offices, the promise included within the text of the Framework cannot be achieved. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on the draft 2023 Mathematics Framework. As always, we are happy to provide additional details or answer any questions. Sincerely," -1	"The CMF's Vision of teaching math will harm our black and brown students I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54) The majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students, regardless of their skin color; in mathematics, this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards. What does the CMF suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups? Does the CMF devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students? Unfortunately, the CMF is instead focused on ensuring these students have "authentic experiences" and that teachers "center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics." (Ch 2 line 513) This is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer; who thinks that will help? Everyone knows you get better at soccer (and in our case, math) by learning and practicing. Rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of "show" to help them learn, let's support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the CAASPP. Following are the major ways in which the CMF will harm black and brown students. 1. The CMF proposes all content fit within 4 "Content Connections" (CC's), two of which are NOT MAJOR according to the 2013 California Content Standards. Students with teachers who focus on these 4 CC's will lose ground compared with their peers who have teachers who ignore this advice and instead teach the content standards or those who will get tutors or outside support. a. In the 2013 CA Math Framework (and also noted in the Blueprint for the CAASPP exam), standards are labeled as the "major" work of the grade level or labeled as "additional" or "supporting" standards. It is explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations), and ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The 4 CC's, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). 1 So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) says are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? As the CMF says repeatedly, it might be more "engaging" and help them develop "positive math identities' ', but this will leave them further behind. The 4 CC's are then connected to "Big Ideas", which the CMF tells teachers to "teach from" instead of "individual content standards" (even though some content standards, such as grade 5 NBT 7, include students adding, subtract, multiplying decimals to the hundredths). Why can't a teacher spend a month or more on that major, individual standard? 2. The CMF focuses on "engagement" through "authentic tasks" over mastery of content. a. The CMF uses the phrase "Engaging" or "student engagement" in reference to ensuring students are "engaged" by the math 120 times. For comparison, the use of "proficiency" in math content appears 11 times and "mastery" of math content 9 times. How disappointing that the CMF is more concerned with engagement than the learning of math content standards. Following is a description of what engaging math is according to the authors of the CMF. "Research shows that students achieve at higher levels when they are actively engaged in the learning process (Boaler, 2016; CAST, n.d.).Educators can increase student engagement by selecting challenging mathematics problems that invite all learners . . . _ involve multiple content areas; _ highlight contributions of diverse cultural groups; _ invite curiosity; _ allow for multiple approaches, collaboration, and representations in multiple languages; and _ carry the expectation that students will use mathematical reasoning" (Ch 6 Line 170) If you have ever known or worked with a struggling math student (which, again, is roughly 67% of all CA students and 80-85% of black and brown students), you know they are not engaged by "challenging math problems", they do not have time to work on "multiple content areas" when so far behind, and highlighting contributions of diverse cultural groups does not make the learning of the math any easier. b. The CMF uses the phrase "authentic" to describe the types of tasks they want teachers to create or use 109 times; again, compare this with the 11 times proficiency in math appears, the 9 times mastery of math appears or even the 71 times "fluency" appears (of which many times the CMF discusses "fluency" in a negative light.) It is clear the CMF prioritizes "authentic" tasks over student mastery of content standards. While most would agree that it is wonderful to have students see the need for mathematics and experience the application of 2 math in relevant contexts, this can not be the sole focus of a teacher. For our struggling students to improve, there needs to be a strong emphasis in a CA Math Framework on also having students achieve procedural fluency and memorization of facts (even if not via "authentic" tasks). Authentic tasks are defined in the CMF: "An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as straightforward practice of recently learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced "real-world" contexts." (Ch 10, line 92). Additionally, the CMF states, "Authentic describes a problem, activity, or context in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder." (Ch 14 line 40) So, what do "authentic, engaging tasks" look like? In a Vignette of a grade 4 classroom (Appendix C, Line 2001) we read of this engaging task: "He begins the lesson by showing students the image of a rectangle with each length side labeled L and each width side labeled W. He asks them to write an expression for the perimeter of this rectangle using the given variables." How is this "a question about which a student actually wonders"? How is this engaging? The CMF is also full of other examples that do involve real world contexts, but then involve little to no math learning. For example, Chapter 7 line 832 discusses how a teacher has her students understand bird houses being built. After learning about the houses and then working with partners to draft their own questions to study, the CMF explains, "Four questions in particular seem fruitful to explore mathematically. After the class helps her further clarify them, she writes the final questions on the board and has each student pair choose one that the partners will investigate. She gives them 20 minutes, after which they will report their findings to the class by making a small poster. The questions are: 1.Why do the birds like to build nests in the houses like this? Why not all single chamber houses, for example?" How is this "fruitful to explore" mathematically? This is a middle school class. How will spending an entire class period on this help black and brown students to increase their math proficiency? 3. The CMF rejects any focus on procedural fluency and memorization of math facts, though at times the CMF even notes that this is needed for success in other math topics. a. In regards to students being given steps to follow, the CMF states, "Lists of steps should only be provided when generated by students themselves in describing their steps on particular problems, lest students trade active reasoning from intrinsic properties to a reliance upon rote procedural skills." (Ch 3, line 1340) What about students who do not "generate" the "list of steps" by themselves? 3 Are they just left further behind? This will not help our students who are below proficient already. The CMF also states, "They must also avoid any temptation to conflate fluency and speed." (Ch 6, Line 1650) Without speed in multiplication facts, black and brown students (and all students) will continue to fail as they matriculate into middle and high school. In one more example, the CMF states, "Exercises (i.e., tasks for which students already have the tools) should either be embedded in a larger problem that is motivating (e.g., an authentic problem, perhaps involving patterns, games, or real-world contexts, such as environmental or social justice), or should address strategies whose improvement will help students accomplish some motivating goal." (Ch 1 line 616) So, the CMF is proposing students don't just practice flashcards (like most of us did for decades) or do worksheets or listen to songs to help them memorize unless these relate to a real world context? In a similar vein, the CMF states, "In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as a straightforward practice of recently-learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced real-world contexts (Ch 14 line 46). So clearly all of us who did "straightforward practice" must have not learned math. Again, this type of language from the CMF will cause harm to our already struggling black and brown students. The CMF claims, "By engaging in meaningful activities and explorations, students gain fluency with multiplication and division with numbers up to 10." (Ch 6 line 1413). Where is the evidence to support this, especially against the traditional methods that have helped students memorize multiplication facts for decades? b. The CMF, ironically makes statements about things students need to be fluent in to be successful. We read, " Proficiency with rational numbers written in fraction notation is essential for success in more advanced mathematics such as percentages, ratios and proportions, and algebra." (Ch 6 Line 1720). In another example, the CMF states, "A third-grade student's ability to add and subtract numbers to 1000 fluently (3.NBT.2) is largely dependent on their ability to think of numbers flexibly, to compose and decompose numbers (CC3), and to recognize the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction. For example, a third-grader mentally adds 67 + 84, decomposing by place value, and recognizing that 67 + 84 = (60 + 80) + (7 + 4) = 140 + 11 = 151. Another student, noting that 67 is close to 70, adjusts both addends: 67 + 84 = 70 + 81. Choosing to solve the easier problem, the student computes 70 + 81 = 151" (Ch 3 line 643). First, note that grade 3 students depend upon fluency from K-2; more importantly, though, this "required fluency" to add and subtract numbers within 1000 should be done with pencil and paper as is clearly noted in the 2013 CA Math Framework back when grade 2 students were to be fluent in adding and subtracting within 100. Why is the CMF so against procedural math? Why are we forcing our non-proficient students to do all of this mentally when many will experience more success with pencil and paper? 4 4. The CMF proposes that teachers also teach The Environmental Principles and Content (EP & C's), other content areas (such as science and history) and focus on seeking inequities and problematizing the world instead of mastering math content. While engaging contexts and cross-curricular explorations are beneficial for sure, the burden should not be on the math teacher to also make sure to embed other content areas when students are so far below grade level after school closures in California. The CMF states, "Teachers must be mindful of other considerations that are a high priority for California's education system. These include the EP&Cs, which allow students to examine issues of environmental and social justice." (Ch 1 Line 861) Continuing in that line of thinking, the CMF says, "For example, environmental issues on the school campus or in the local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis, which, concurrently, help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 7 line 237). There is simply not enough time for students to make up for learning loss, learn the current year's math standards and then have time to explore the EP & C's. 5. The CMF has "vignettes" (descriptions of classrooms) which are unrealistic and which will leave struggling students further behind. a. Some vignettes give examples of things not close to grade level standards. For example, Chapter 3 line 389 describes a question to pose to a class: "How many numbers can you create that have values between 1 and 20 using exactly four 4s and any operation?" While this might be a great investigation, the CMF lists as a possible content standard: "K Ð Being flexible within 10 (OA.1, OA.3)", meaning KINDERGARTEN. Grade 1 works with 3 addends; 4 addends are not until grade 2, and this task really is about multiple operations including multiplication and division. Students who are struggling in math will not benefit from teachers posing problems 2-3 years above grade level. b. Some vignettes just describe things that are not realistic in a class, especially one comprised of mostly below proficient students. For example, the CMF says, "The teacher called for the class to explore this conjecture and to see whether they could find a way to prove whether it is always true or not. Now the whole class was interested and trying to prove or disprove Ryan's and Anen's conjecture." (Ch 2 line 709) Really, the whole class is trying to prove a conjecture in elementary school? It's very realistic to expect a good percent of the class to be engaged in this, but those who do not like math and are far behind might find better things to consider (like the bird flying outside or what's in their backpack). For a middle school example of this, the CMF states, "Students can be sure that p times x is another rational number because they have built an intuition about the closure property of multiplication through their prior work in multiplying specific rational numbers together and seeing the answers that are arrived at." (Ch 3 line 1328) We know some of the CMF authors have classroom experience, but lines like this make that hard to believe. "Building an intuition about the closure property of multiplication" is not the typical thinking in a classroom comprised of mostly black and brown students (or any classroom). 5 c. The reason we know that our black and brown students are failing at higher rates is a result of standardized testing. Recognizing, as a state or nation, that our students or a specific sub-group of students are failing might not be possible if the CMF is adopted and followed. The CMF states, "Grades will NOT be based on percentages or averages but instead will be determined holistically." (Ch 12, line 633) How will this approach to grading help us OBJECTIVELY identify needs and work to build supports? 6. The CMF suggests that teachers create all types of tasks to engage and teach their students while differentiating to meet all levels of needs; this leaves a students' success in math up to the teacher; thus inequitable experiences will result. a. The CMF states, in multiple places, that teachers will have to create tasks. "To teach the grade level's big ideas, a teacher will design instructional activities that link one or more of the CCs with a DI." (Ch 7 line 228) Teacher Unions are very strong in California. Teachers can not be expected to create tasks on their own time, so either they need to volunteer to be paid outside the school day or there needs to be built in time for teachers to do this work (keep in mind that most teachers either teach multiple subjects or have multiple math courses to prepare for). The CMF also states, "Teachers can poll their students to find out about their interests and build lessons about data visualization around those interests, both to motivate learning and to bridge cultural divides in the classroom." (Ch 7 line 590) Again, wonderful idea to poll students and create experiences around their interests, but this is incredibly naive and unrealistic for all teachers. Additionally, this will harm black and brown students who are already struggling as only those who get the most amazing teachers who can create these tasks will get the best math experiences; those who get typical teachers will be getting sub-par experiences; furthermore, since the CMF says "maintaining beliefs such as "fidelity to the curriculum" can undermine the focus and coherence called for in chapter 1" (Ch 10 line 764), (thus making following curriculum a bad thing), struggling students will fall further behind. b. The CMF relies upon students "hopefully" coming up with the questions to be able to study the math we want them to learn. The CMF states, "After the question has been raised (hopefully by students), students make some estimates, and then the development of the necessary mathematics is seen as having a purpose." (Ch 8 line 177). What if a black or Latino student is in a class where no one raises the question? Do they just not learn that topic? This type of guidance will harm our most vulnerable students. c. Some vignettes cite math content standards from multiple grade levels. While differentiating is great, if students are all learning different standards, how will next year's teacher know who has learned what and then how wide is the gap they must address? For example, Appendix C line 2325 discusses a vignette entitled "Learning about shapes through sponge art". It is listed as a grade 6 class. Following are the math content standards referenced with this task: á "6.G: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume. 6 á 7.G: Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationship between them. Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume. á 8.EE: Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines and linear equations. Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations. 8.G: Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software. Understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres á 6.G: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume. á 7.G: Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationship between them. Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume." Having tasks with 3 years worth of standards that some students learn and others do not will lead to greater inequities for struggling students, not just during that course, but increasingly in subsequent years as students arrive with all different gaps as teachers were not focused on standards-based instruction. With the focus of the CMF either things not essential in mathematics or upon making math authentic and engaging (over the goal of students mastering math standards, California's black and brown students, who are the farthest below proficient, will continue their downward spiral. The SBE needs to reject this framework and instead provide proven strategies and resources (such as intensive tutoring)that will help black and brown students master math content standards and increase in proficiency." -1	"This is Marxist Math. Our kids are already behind other States in the nation. Use the highest performing states' math curriculum, not this ideologically-driven social science takeover of the hard sciences.

The State of California is becoming further behind other states and countries in math yet we continue to ignore the fact common core is not the best model nor is the proposed rewriting of basic math teaching. I am appalled by the changes that are being recommended. It's becoming so convoluted we are having a hard time determining what subject is even being taught anymore.

" -1	"Math is dying in our classrooms and the kids that need the most help will not get it with this framework Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54) The majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students, regardless of their skin color; in mathematics, this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards. What does the CMF suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups? Does the CMF devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students? Unfortunately, the CMF is instead focused on ensuring these students have "authentic experiences" and that teachers "center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics." (Ch 2 line 513) This is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer; who thinks that will help? Everyone knows you get better at soccer (and in our case, math) by learning and practicing. Rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of "show" to help them learn, let's support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the CAASPP. Following are the major ways in which the CMF will harm black and brown students. 1. The CMF proposes all content fit within 4 "Content Connections" (CC's), two of which are NOT MAJOR according to the 2013 California Content Standards. Students with teachers who focus on these 4 CC's will lose ground compared with their peers who have teachers who ignore this advice and instead teach the content standards or those who will get tutors or outside support. a. In the 2013 CA Math Framework (and also noted in the Blueprint for the CAASPP exam), standards are labeled as the "major" work of the grade level or labeled as "additional" or "supporting" standards. It is explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations), and ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The 4 CC's, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). 1 So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) says are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? As the CMF says repeatedly, it might be more "engaging" and help them develop "positive math identities' ', but this will leave them further behind. The 4 CC's are then connected to "Big Ideas", which the CMF tells teachers to "teach from" instead of "individual content standards" (even though some content standards, such as grade 5 NBT 7, include students adding, subtract, multiplying decimals to the hundredths). Why can't a teacher spend a month or more on that major, individual standard? 2. The CMF focuses on "engagement" through "authentic tasks" over mastery of content. a. The CMF uses the phrase "Engaging" or "student engagement" in reference to ensuring students are "engaged" by the math 120 times. For comparison, the use of "proficiency" in math content appears 11 times and "mastery" of math content 9 times. How disappointing that the CMF is more concerned with engagement than the learning of math content standards. Following is a description of what engaging math is according to the authors of the CMF. "Research shows that students achieve at higher levels when they are actively engaged in the learning process (Boaler, 2016; CAST, n.d.).Educators can increase student engagement by selecting challenging mathematics problems that invite all learners . . . _ involve multiple content areas; _ highlight contributions of diverse cultural groups; _ invite curiosity; _ allow for multiple approaches, collaboration, and representations in multiple languages; and _ carry the expectation that students will use mathematical reasoning" (Ch 6 Line 170) If you have ever known or worked with a struggling math student (which, again, is roughly 67% of all CA students and 80-85% of black and brown students), you know they are not engaged by "challenging math problems", they do not have time to work on "multiple content areas" when so far behind, and highlighting contributions of diverse cultural groups does not make the learning of the math any easier. b. The CMF uses the phrase "authentic" to describe the types of tasks they want teachers to create or use 109 times; again, compare this with the 11 times proficiency in math appears, the 9 times mastery of math appears or even the 71 times "fluency" appears (of which many times the CMF discusses "fluency" in a negative light.) It is clear the CMF prioritizes "authentic" tasks over student mastery of content standards. While most would agree that it is wonderful to have students see the need for mathematics and experience the application of 2 math in relevant contexts, this can not be the sole focus of a teacher. For our struggling students to improve, there needs to be a strong emphasis in a CA Math Framework on also having students achieve procedural fluency and memorization of facts (even if not via "authentic" tasks). Authentic tasks are defined in the CMF: "An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as straightforward practice of recently learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced "real-world" contexts." (Ch 10, line 92). Additionally, the CMF states, "Authentic describes a problem, activity, or context in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder." (Ch 14 line 40) So, what do "authentic, engaging tasks" look like? In a Vignette of a grade 4 classroom (Appendix C, Line 2001) we read of this engaging task: "He begins the lesson by showing students the image of a rectangle with each length side labeled L and each width side labeled W. He asks them to write an expression for the perimeter of this rectangle using the given variables." How is this "a question about which a student actually wonders"? How is this engaging? The CMF is also full of other examples that do involve real world contexts, but then involve little to no math learning. For example, Chapter 7 line 832 discusses how a teacher has her students understand bird houses being built. After learning about the houses and then working with partners to draft their own questions to study, the CMF explains, "Four questions in particular seem fruitful to explore mathematically. After the class helps her further clarify them, she writes the final questions on the board and has each student pair choose one that the partners will investigate. She gives them 20 minutes, after which they will report their findings to the class by making a small poster. The questions are: 1.Why do the birds like to build nests in the houses like this? Why not all single chamber houses, for example?" How is this "fruitful to explore" mathematically? This is a middle school class. How will spending an entire class period on this help black and brown students to increase their math proficiency? 3. The CMF rejects any focus on procedural fluency and memorization of math facts, though at times the CMF even notes that this is needed for success in other math topics. a. In regards to students being given steps to follow, the CMF states, "Lists of steps should only be provided when generated by students themselves in describing their steps on particular problems, lest students trade active reasoning from intrinsic properties to a reliance upon rote procedural skills." (Ch 3, line 1340) What about students who do not "generate" the "list of steps" by themselves? 3 Are they just left further behind? This will not help our students who are below proficient already. The CMF also states, "They must also avoid any temptation to conflate fluency and speed." (Ch 6, Line 1650) Without speed in multiplication facts, black and brown students (and all students) will continue to fail as they matriculate into middle and high school. In one more example, the CMF states, "Exercises (i.e., tasks for which students already have the tools) should either be embedded in a larger problem that is motivating (e.g., an authentic problem, perhaps involving patterns, games, or real-world contexts, such as environmental or social justice), or should address strategies whose improvement will help students accomplish some motivating goal." (Ch 1 line 616) So, the CMF is proposing students don't just practice flashcards (like most of us did for decades) or do worksheets or listen to songs to help them memorize unless these relate to a real world context? In a similar vein, the CMF states, "In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as a straightforward practice of recently-learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced real-world contexts (Ch 14 line 46). So clearly all of us who did "straightforward practice" must have not learned math. Again, this type of language from the CMF will cause harm to our already struggling black and brown students. The CMF claims, "By engaging in meaningful activities and explorations, students gain fluency with multiplication and division with numbers up to 10." (Ch 6 line 1413). Where is the evidence to support this, especially against the traditional methods that have helped students memorize multiplication facts for decades? b. The CMF, ironically makes statements about things students need to be fluent in to be successful. We read, " Proficiency with rational numbers written in fraction notation is essential for success in more advanced mathematics such as percentages, ratios and proportions, and algebra." (Ch 6 Line 1720). In another example, the CMF states, "A third-grade student's ability to add and subtract numbers to 1000 fluently (3.NBT.2) is largely dependent on their ability to think of numbers flexibly, to compose and decompose numbers (CC3), and to recognize the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction. For example, a third-grader mentally adds 67 + 84, decomposing by place value, and recognizing that 67 + 84 = (60 + 80) + (7 + 4) = 140 + 11 = 151. Another student, noting that 67 is close to 70, adjusts both addends: 67 + 84 = 70 + 81. Choosing to solve the easier problem, the student computes 70 + 81 = 151" (Ch 3 line 643). First, note that grade 3 students depend upon fluency from K-2; more importantly, though, this "required fluency" to add and subtract numbers within 1000 should be done with pencil and paper as is clearly noted in the 2013 CA Math Framework back when grade 2 students were to be fluent in adding and subtracting within 100. Why is the CMF so against procedural math? Why are we forcing our non-proficient students to do all of this mentally when many will experience more success with pencil and paper? 4 4. The CMF proposes that teachers also teach The Environmental Principles and Content (EP & C's), other content areas (such as science and history) and focus on seeking inequities and problematizing the world instead of mastering math content. While engaging contexts and cross-curricular explorations are beneficial for sure, the burden should not be on the math teacher to also make sure to embed other content areas when students are so far below grade level after school closures in California. The CMF states, "Teachers must be mindful of other considerations that are a high priority for California's education system. These include the EP&Cs, which allow students to examine issues of environmental and social justice." (Ch 1 Line 861) Continuing in that line of thinking, the CMF says, "For example, environmental issues on the school campus or in the local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis, which, concurrently, help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 7 line 237). There is simply not enough time for students to make up for learning loss, learn the current year's math standards and then have time to explore the EP & C's. 5. The CMF has "vignettes" (descriptions of classrooms) which are unrealistic and which will leave struggling students further behind. a. Some vignettes give examples of things not close to grade level standards. For example, Chapter 3 line 389 describes a question to pose to a class: "How many numbers can you create that have values between 1 and 20 using exactly four 4s and any operation?"

Thank you, Kristin Nugent Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"Once again, this seems to be a flawed change that will set our students back and harm the most vulnerable ones.

Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"If we are going to amend the curriculum isnshould be for the goal of making sure the student is successful.

It has many serious issues. Specifically, multiple cited references are not supported by the evidence.

With the right support of teachers to implement, this framework has more access points for students of variety of backgrounds that have not had the access in the past (language learners, BIPOC, women, and more) through equity lenses. Students struggle to become what they cannot see or, if the material can't meet them where they are, they miss out on the potential to further explore their world and become the future Mathematicians that we need them to be in whatever field they chose to pursue. Furthermore, this framework does not diminish the opportunity for students who currently excel in their math progress, but it does challenge them to expand their thinking and build connections outside of math. This fluency and flexibility is vital to their success too. Many careers are not singularly conceptually focused (engineers aren't just running derivatives all day). This framework will challenge students to be build muscle around problem solving, resiliency, and mathematical processes to find solutions to complex problems.

" -1	"First of all, the committee is trying to ram this proposal through with a public comment period just after school year ends when many people are on vacation, and allowing only a shambolic 2 week review period when there are more than 1000 pages of material to be reviewed. Is the committee concerned about the unpopularity of the CMF that it is not willing to provide a reasonable public comment period? This is akin to the White House trying to hide bad news from the public by releasing it on a Friday evening. Second of all, this CMF is baloney. The framework substantially reduces the rigor of the math curriculum so students can feel good about themselves for achieving more to a lower standard. This is merely creating an illusion for the students that they are achieving something when in fact they are merely falling further behind compared to other states, and other countries in the world. If one wants to see what a rigorous math curriculum looks like, they can just get an elementary math book from Singapore, which is readily sold online in the United States, and one can see that by the fifth grade, Singapore students are already at least 1 grade level farther along than the current common core standard. And the CMF is reducing the rigor of the curriculum even further in the name of 'helping more students'. An A achieved with a lower standard is just illusory achievement. The sense of accomplishment and belonging you are trying to instill is just as fake, and no different from giving everyone who participate in a sports competition a medal merely for participating. Besides the concerns I have of the CMF, I also have tremendous concern about how the CMF was drafted. As of 2020, California is a highly diverse state with 40% Latino and 15% Asian. The CMF was drafted with heavy input from white math education researchers who make recommendations on how math should be taught to the colored communities, but these researchers have minimal exposure on actual day-to-day struggles of these communities, AND stand to profit handsomely from their consulting on math education/ framework with such communities. Case in point, Jo Boaler and her $5000/ hr consulting with the Oxnard school district. That is a blatant conflict of interest and needs to be called out as highly unethical. Please fix the CMF by increasing the rigor of the curriculum, and before that, form a committee that reflects the current demographic makeup of the state. Sampson Shen. Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." -1	"I am not convinced that these standards are based on reputable research, and I oppose implementing them. Sufficient objections have been raised by Tom Loveless, who has a BA from UC Berkeley and a PhD from the University of Chicago, one of our nation's premier research universities. Loveless points out that those who support implementing the new standards have based their research on studies that fail to meet scientific standards. I encourage you to read his article on Education Next: https://www.educationnext.org/californias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.educationnext.org/californias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!bewsSlzr3duXq97RP-LDDKVgyfJQzn0dXj3nOX5n2ga__gXpQpfYJLr8RwtbtwjVWe7xWto2KK-Gj7EEFXKoT-G36DmqWMVg$] As an educator, I believe that if these standards are introduced, we will see a widening achievement gap in math, statewide, between wealthy and poor students.

Instead, tutor the kids needing help. REJECT REJECT REJECT! " -1	"The Framework gives significant self-contradictory guidance on middle school acceleration paths that needs to be fixed before this Framework can become policy. These are drastic revisions required or the Framework must be rejected. One example is the Framework's description of a claimed middle school acceleration pathway on Chapter 8 line 825 (shown at the bottom), where a student Kai takes "Mathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III during the first year of high school". If this student is in a district with a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Mathematics I starting in 9th grade, which is the district the Framework guides for in their math pathway diagram Figure 8.4 and accompanying description, the district would be forcing the student to repeat classes the student is already proficient in. This is illegal as defined by the education codes EDC 51224.7, EDC 51228.2, and EDC 51224.5. Since, for a district that imposed a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" on its students with Math I starting in 9th grade, this student Kai would not be able to move on in the math pathway she is currently on because that district would have to offer a variety of classes to its 9th grade students including Mathematics I, Mathematics II, and Mathematics III, in short, not a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Math I in 9th, it is clear that this pathway does not exist in a district that adopts the Framework's recommendation of a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Math I in 9th grade . The Framework needs to make it perfectly clear that this pathway is not possible in a district that adopts the Framework and the Framework's recommendation of a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Math I in 9th. A public document cannot be misleading to districts. Phrasing needs to be inserted at the beginning of the section to clearly clarify this to districts such that contradictory guidance is not given. It needs to be amended, perhaps as follows: Insert above Ch 8, L 825: "For a district that does not impose a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Math I in 9th on its students, and allows multiple student pathways in grades before 11, especially those of acceleration where acceleration means enabling students to enroll in a class a grade level, or in the case of the student described below, two grades levels above her peers, and especially in middle school, in short, in a district that DOES NOT ADOPT the Framework, then the following example pathway is possible: The above to inserted above the Framework quote C 8 L 825 repeated below: "The student Kai is interested in robotics engineering and was able to take Mathematics I and II in junior high and Mathematics III during the first year of high school. By completing Precalculus in the second year, Kai is able to take AP Calculus in the third year. This enables multiple options for Kai's fourth year, such as taking her school's data science course, or a programming and data science course at the local community college, multivariable calculus, or other college courses." It is obvious this student Kai lives in a district which has accelerated math pathways in middle school. This pathway of Kai, and a district which has a "common ninth- and tenth-grade experience" with Math I starting in 9th grade as the Framework guides for, are fundamentally self-contradictory. It is unacceptable to have a document that can affect so many children nationwide to be fraught with obvious inconsistencies. A major revision is required or this Framework must not be approved. " -1	"The CMF is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54) The majority of teachers go into education to better the lives of students, regardless of their skin color; in mathematics, this means helping all their students achieve proficiency in math content standards. What does the CMF suggest to teachers to help increase the proficiency of these ethnic groups? Does the CMF devote extensive time to discussing successful intervention and tutoring programs which raise test scores for these students? Unfortunately, the CMF is instead focused on ensuring these students have "authentic experiences" and that teachers "center contributions that historically marginalized people have made to mathematics." (Ch 2 line 513) This is akin to saying you will help someone get better at soccer by showing them people from their ethnic group who are experts and then getting them excited about soccer; who thinks that will help? Everyone knows you get better at soccer (and in our case, math) by learning and practicing. Rather than assume our black and brown students need some type of "show" to help them learn, let's support them to put in the hard work to master math content standards and achieve proficiency on the CAASPP. Following are the major ways in which the CMF will harm black and brown students. 1. The CMF proposes all content fit within 4 "Content Connections" (CC's), two of which are NOT MAJOR according to the 2013 California Content Standards. Students with teachers who focus on these 4 CC's will lose ground compared with their peers who have teachers who ignore this advice and instead teach the content standards or those who will get tutors or outside support. a. In the 2013 CA Math Framework (and also noted in the Blueprint for the CAASPP exam), standards are labeled as the "major" work of the grade level or labeled as "additional" or "supporting" standards. It is explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations), and ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The 4 CC's, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). 1 So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) says are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? As the CMF says repeatedly, it might be more "engaging" and help them develop "positive math identities' ', but this will leave them further behind. The 4 CC's are then connected to "Big Ideas", which the CMF tells teachers to "teach from" instead of "individual content standards" (even though some content standards, such as grade 5 NBT 7, include students adding, subtract, multiplying decimals to the hundredths). Why can't a teacher spend a month or more on that major, individual standard? 2. The CMF focuses on "engagement" through "authentic tasks" over mastery of content. a. The CMF uses the phrase "Engaging" or "student engagement" in reference to ensuring students are "engaged" by the math 120 times. For comparison, the use of "proficiency" in math content appears 11 times and "mastery" of math content 9 times. How disappointing that the CMF is more concerned with engagement than the learning of math content standards. Following is a description of what engaging math is according to the authors of the CMF. "Research shows that students achieve at higher levels when they are actively engaged in the learning process (Boaler, 2016; CAST, n.d.).Educators can increase student engagement by selecting challenging mathematics problems that invite all learners . . . _ involve multiple content areas; _ highlight contributions of diverse cultural groups; _ invite curiosity; _ allow for multiple approaches, collaboration, and representations in multiple languages; and _ carry the expectation that students will use mathematical reasoning" (Ch 6 Line 170) If you have ever known or worked with a struggling math student (which, again, is roughly 67% of all CA students and 80-85% of black and brown students), you know they are not engaged by "challenging math problems", they do not have time to work on "multiple content areas" when so far behind, and highlighting contributions of diverse cultural groups does not make the learning of the math any easier. b. The CMF uses the phrase "authentic" to describe the types of tasks they want teachers to create or use 109 times; again, compare this with the 11 times proficiency in math appears, the 9 times mastery of math appears or even the 71 times "fluency" appears (of which many times the CMF discusses "fluency" in a negative light.) It is clear the CMF prioritizes "authentic" tasks over student mastery of content standards. While most would agree that it is wonderful to have students see the need for mathematics and experience the application of 2 math in relevant contexts, this can not be the sole focus of a teacher. For our struggling students to improve, there needs to be a strong emphasis in a CA Math Framework on also having students achieve procedural fluency and memorization of facts (even if not via "authentic" tasks). Authentic tasks are defined in the CMF: "An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as straightforward practice of recently learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced "real-world" contexts." (Ch 10, line 92). Additionally, the CMF states, "Authentic describes a problem, activity, or context in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder." (Ch 14 line 40) So, what do "authentic, engaging tasks" look like? In a Vignette of a grade 4 classroom (Appendix C, Line 2001) we read of this engaging task: "He begins the lesson by showing students the image of a rectangle with each length side labeled L and each width side labeled W. He asks them to write an expression for the perimeter of this rectangle using the given variables." How is this "a question about which a student actually wonders"? How is this engaging? The CMF is also full of other examples that do involve real world contexts, but then involve little to no math learning. For example, Chapter 7 line 832 discusses how a teacher has her students understand bird houses being built. After learning about the houses and then working with partners to draft their own questions to study, the CMF explains, "Four questions in particular seem fruitful to explore mathematically. After the class helps her further clarify them, she writes the final questions on the board and has each student pair choose one that the partners will investigate. She gives them 20 minutes, after which they will report their findings to the class by making a small poster. The questions are: 1.Why do the birds like to build nests in the houses like this? Why not all single chamber houses, for example?" How is this "fruitful to explore" mathematically? This is a middle school class. How will spending an entire class period on this help black and brown students to increase their math proficiency? 3. The CMF rejects any focus on procedural fluency and memorization of math facts, though at times the CMF even notes that this is needed for success in other math topics. a. In regards to students being given steps to follow, the CMF states, "Lists of steps should only be provided when generated by students themselves in describing their steps on particular problems, lest students trade active reasoning from intrinsic properties to a reliance upon rote procedural skills." (Ch 3, line 1340) What about students who do not "generate" the "list of steps" by themselves? 3 Are they just left further behind? This will not help our students who are below proficient already. The CMF also states, "They must also avoid any temptation to conflate fluency and speed." (Ch 6, Line 1650) Without speed in multiplication facts, black and brown students (and all students) will continue to fail as they matriculate into middle and high school. In one more example, the CMF states, "Exercises (i.e., tasks for which students already have the tools) should either be embedded in a larger problem that is motivating (e.g., an authentic problem, perhaps involving patterns, games, or real-world contexts, such as environmental or social justice), or should address strategies whose improvement will help students accomplish some motivating goal." (Ch 1 line 616) So, the CMF is proposing students don't just practice flashcards (like most of us did for decades) or do worksheets or listen to songs to help them memorize unless these relate to a real world context? In a similar vein, the CMF states, "In contrast, an activity is inauthentic if students recognize it as a straightforward practice of recently-learned techniques or procedures, including the repackaging of standard exercises in forced real-world contexts (Ch 14 line 46). So clearly all of us who did "straightforward practice" must have not learned math. Again, this type of language from the CMF will cause harm to our already struggling black and brown students. The CMF claims, "By engaging in meaningful activities and explorations, students gain fluency with multiplication and division with numbers up to 10." (Ch 6 line 1413). Where is the evidence to support this, especially against the traditional methods that have helped students memorize multiplication facts for decades? b. The CMF, ironically makes statements about things students need to be fluent in to be successful. We read, " Proficiency with rational numbers written in fraction notation is essential for success in more advanced mathematics such as percentages, ratios and proportions, and algebra." (Ch 6 Line 1720). In another example, the CMF states, "A third-grade student's ability to add and subtract numbers to 1000 fluently (3.NBT.2) is largely dependent on their ability to think of numbers flexibly, to compose and decompose numbers (CC3), and to recognize the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction. For example, a third-grader mentally adds 67 + 84, decomposing by place value, and recognizing that 67 + 84 = (60 + 80) + (7 + 4) = 140 + 11 = 151. Another student, noting that 67 is close to 70, adjusts both addends: 67 + 84 = 70 + 81. Choosing to solve the easier problem, the student computes 70 + 81 = 151" (Ch 3 line 643). First, note that grade 3 students depend upon fluency from K-2; more importantly, though, this "required fluency" to add and subtract numbers within 1000 should be done with pencil and paper as is clearly noted in the 2013 CA Math Framework back when grade 2 students were to be fluent in adding and subtracting within 100. Why is the CMF so against procedural math? Why are we forcing our non-proficient students to do all of this mentally when many will experience more success with pencil and paper? 4 4. The CMF proposes that teachers also teach The Environmental Principles and Content (EP & C's), other content areas (such as science and history) and focus on seeking inequities and problematizing the world instead of mastering math content. While engaging contexts and cross-curricular explorations are beneficial for sure, the burden should not be on the math teacher to also make sure to embed other content areas when students are so far below grade level after school closures in California. The CMF states, "Teachers must be mindful of other considerations that are a high priority for California's education system. These include the EP&Cs, which allow students to examine issues of environmental and social justice." (Ch 1 Line 861) Continuing in that line of thinking, the CMF says, "For example, environmental issues on the school campus or in the local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis, which, concurrently, help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 7 line 237). There is simply not enough time for students to make up for learning loss, learn the current year's math standards and then have time to explore the EP & C's. 5. The CMF has "vignettes" (descriptions of classrooms) which are unrealistic and which will leave struggling students further behind. a. Some vignettes give examples of things not close to grade level standards. For example, Chapter 3 line 389 describes a question to pose to a class: "How many numbers can you create that have values between 1 and 20 using exactly four 4s and any operation?" While this might be a great investigation, the CMF lists as a possible content standard: "K Ð Being flexible within 10 (OA.1, OA.3)", meaning KINDERGARTEN. Grade 1 works with 3 addends; 4 addends are not until grade 2, and this task really is about multiple operations including multiplication and division. Students who are struggling in math will not benefit from teachers posing problems 2-3 years above grade level. b. Some vignettes just describe things that are not realistic in a class, especially one comprised of mostly below proficient students. For example, the CMF says, "The teacher called for the class to explore this conjecture and to see whether they could find a way to prove whether it is always true or not. Now the whole class was interested and trying to prove or disprove Ryan's and Anen's conjecture." (Ch 2 line 709) Really, the whole class is trying to prove a conjecture in elementary school? It's very realistic to expect a good percent of the class to be engaged in this, but those who do not like math and are far behind might find better things to consider (like the bird flying outside or what's in their backpack). For a middle school example of this, the CMF states, "Students can be sure that p times x is another rational number because they have built an intuition about the closure property of multiplication through their prior work in multiplying specific rational numbers together and seeing the answers that are arrived at." (Ch 3 line 1328) We know some of the CMF authors have classroom experience, but lines like this make that hard to believe. "Building an intuition about the closure property of multiplication" is not the typical thinking in a classroom comprised of mostly black and brown students (or any classroom). 5 c. The reason we know that our black and brown students are failing at higher rates is a result of standardized testing. Recognizing, as a state or nation, that our students or a specific sub-group of students are failing might not be possible if the CMF is adopted and followed. The CMF states, "Grades will NOT be based on percentages or averages but instead will be determined holistically." (Ch 12, line 633) How will this approach to grading help us OBJECTIVELY identify needs and work to build supports? 6. The CMF suggests that teachers create all types of tasks to engage and teach their students while differentiating to meet all levels of needs; this leaves a students' success in math up to the teacher; thus inequitable experiences will result. a. The CMF states, in multiple places, that teachers will have to create tasks. "To teach the grade level's big ideas, a teacher will design instructional activities that link one or more of the CCs with a DI." (Ch 7 line 228) Teacher Unions are very strong in California. Teachers can not be expected to create tasks on their own time, so either they need to volunteer to be paid outside the school day or there needs to be built in time for teachers to do this work (keep in mind that most teachers either teach multiple subjects or have multiple math courses to prepare for). The CMF also states, "Teachers can poll their students to find out about their interests and build lessons about data visualization around those interests, both to motivate learning and to bridge cultural divides in the classroom." (Ch 7 line 590) Again, wonderful idea to poll students and create experiences around their interests, but this is incredibly naive and unrealistic for all teachers. Additionally, this will harm black and brown students who are already struggling as only those who get the most amazing teachers who can create these tasks will get the best math experiences; those who get typical teachers will be getting sub-par experiences; furthermore, since the CMF says "maintaining beliefs such as "fidelity to the curriculum" can undermine the focus and coherence called for in chapter 1" (Ch 10 line 764), (thus making following curriculum a bad thing), struggling students will fall further behind. b. The CMF relies upon students "hopefully" coming up with the questions to be able to study the math we want them to learn. The CMF states, "After the question has been raised (hopefully by students), students make some estimates, and then the development of the necessary mathematics is seen as having a purpose." (Ch 8 line 177). What if a black or Latino student is in a class where no one raises the question? Do they just not learn that topic? This type of guidance will harm our most vulnerable students. c. Some vignettes cite math content standards from multiple grade levels. While differentiating is great, if students are all learning different standards, how will next year's teacher know who has learned what and then how wide is the gap they must address? For example, Appendix C line 2325 discusses a vignette entitled "Learning about shapes through sponge art". It is listed as a grade 6 class. Following are the math content standards referenced with this task: á "6.G: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume. 6 á 7.G: Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationship between them. Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume. á 8.EE: Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines and linear equations. Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations. 8.G: Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry software. Understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres á 6.G: Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume. á 7.G: Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationship between them. Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume." Having tasks with 3 years worth of standards that some students learn and others do not will lead to greater inequities for struggling students, not just during that course, but increasingly in subsequent years as students arrive with all different gaps as teachers were not focused on standards-based instruction. With the focus of the CMF either things not essential in mathematics or upon making math authentic and engaging (over the goal of students mastering math standards, California's black and brown students, who are the farthest below proficient, will continue their downward spiral. The SBE needs to reject this framework and instead provide proven strategies and resources (such as intensive tutoring)that will help black and brown students master math content standards and increase in proficiency." -1	"You need to REJECT the proposed CMF.

Until just recently when I began working full-time, we were a low-income, working-class family. I set the context because I am appalled and saddened that California would want to punish someone like my son who was identified as profoundly gifted at age 6. He *adored* math and began algebra at age 8, moving into geometry in 4th grade and calculus in middle school. Imagine if he was held back because of low expectations. I would have crushed his intellectual curiosity. Instead, I let him fly, pursuing what he loved, and he graduated from MIT 7 years ago debt-free because MIT was so generous with need-based aid. As an ex-public school teacher who saw the writing on the wall early with my son, I chose to homeschool him because I knew he would be subjected to the bigotry of low expectations in public school. We need to raise the bar for all children, but perhaps most particularly, students from under-represented groups! Lowing math standards would be a disaster! California public education is already near the bottom of the country in results. We've strayed away from excellence in education and from teaching academics. Please, please don't make it worse.

" -1	"I am writing to oppose the adoption of the 2023 Math framework. Despite being toned down in recent revisions it is still flawed at the core in its promotion of social justice throughout. It claims that each component of classroom instruction is based on research and supported by practice, but let's examine that. When it says that it is 'based on research', does this refer to research produced by education schools, which are broadly considered to be the intellectual dregs of academia? Why should this research be trusted? Last year I got to talk with a student going for his educational doctorate who eventually decided to leave the program. He said that his advisor had a long-standing theory that she had worked so long on that any research that went against her theory was no different than going against her personally, so that the only acceptable 'research' was that which further supported her theory. In other words, don't expect to get your degree if your findings contradict my dogma. Is that the sort of research we're talking about? How about the second part? 'supported by practice'. What practice are these components supported by? By 'practice' do you mean that these components are already used in schools? Are these the same schools that keep getting worse and worse every year? If 1) social justice has become increasingly a part of education based on research, and 2) students increasingly can't do math, why exactly should we listen to that research? If students were doing better in math before social justice had been shoehorned into every nook and cranny of math education, why would we double down on the idea? Research is only useful if it is falsifiable, and if researchers and practitioners are honest with themselves about whether something is working. You are not being honest with yourselves. The best way to make these students to feel good about themselves is to give them general, transferrable skills, not to try and tap into their emotions. Stop trying to teach outside of your area of expertise. Many K-12 teachers are barely competent to teach math, but at least they have some training in that. They have no training in social work. Stop trying to shove politics into our schools. Teach students how to think in a disciplined, organized manner, and they'll have the tools to come to their own conclusions. We don't give you our children in order to indoctrinate them into whatever weak ideologies your handful of years in our universities' weakest programs indoctrinated you with.

" 1	"Dear Members of the State Board of Education, I am writing to express my strong support for the adoption of the new California Mathematics Framework, particularly with regards to its impact on elementary students and equity. I was part of the California Mathematics CFCC and am proud of the work that we created as a team as we kept equity at the front of center of our work. I sought to become part of the CFCC to provide clarity in the framework guided by the principles of equity to create better mathematical structures and outcomes for our students. As an elementary math coach, I have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by teachers in changing the math experience of students in their classrooms. The proposed changes provide comprehensive solutions to address these challenges and empower educators to create an equitable and meaningful learning environment for all students. Chapter 1 lays a solid foundation by emphasizing the importance of mathematical coherence and the sequential development of mathematical concepts. This chapter provides clarity and guidance to teachers, enabling them to align their instruction with the progression of mathematical ideas. As a math coach, this framework will serve as a valuable resource for me in supporting teachers as they navigate the intricacies of building a coherent and robust mathematics curriculum. Chapter 2 focuses on mathematical practices, which are essential for developing students' mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities. By explicitly highlighting these practices, the new framework provides teachers with a framework for fostering critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills among their students. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to help teachers incorporate these practices into their instruction, thereby empowering students to become confident mathematical thinkers. Chapter 3 addresses the critical need for differentiated instruction to cater to the diverse needs of students. It provides strategies and resources to help teachers meet students where they are and support their individual growth. The framework acknowledges that students come from varied backgrounds and possess differing levels of prior knowledge. As a math coach, this chapter equips me with practical tools to guide teachers in creating inclusive and equitable classrooms where every student can access high-quality math instruction. Chapter 4 emphasizes the importance of culturally responsive teaching in mathematics education. It recognizes that students' cultural backgrounds and experiences play a crucial role in their mathematical understanding. By incorporating culturally relevant examples and contexts, teachers can foster student engagement and deepen their mathematical understanding. The framework equips me as a math coach to support teachers in creating culturally responsive classrooms that celebrate diversity and promote a positive math identity for all students. Chapter 5 focuses on assessment practices that are aligned with the principles of equity and student-centered learning. It emphasizes the use of formative assessment strategies to inform instructional decisions and provide timely feedback to students. This chapter enables teachers to make data-driven instructional choices, ensuring that all students receive the necessary support and intervention. As a math coach, I can help teachers implement effective assessment practices that promote equitable learning opportunities for all students. Chapter 6, as previously mentioned, promotes a balanced approach to teaching mathematics by integrating procedural fluency and conceptual understanding. This chapter equips teachers with the tools to develop students' mathematical proficiency while fostering a deep understanding of mathematical concepts that centers on "Big Ideas." As a math coach, I can help teachers navigate this balance and provide guidance on instructional strategies that promote both procedural skills and conceptual understanding. Chapters 9, 10, and 12 address the critical areas of technology integration, family engagement, and professional learning, respectively. These chapters recognize the importance of leveraging technology, involving families in the mathematics learning process, and providing ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers. As a math coach, I can utilize the framework to support teachers in effectively integrating technology, fostering family partnerships, and accessing relevant professional learning opportunities. Finally, Chapter 13 is crucial as it provides guidance for curriculum publishers to create better instructional materials that center on big ideas, use tasks worthy of student engagement; and embed exercises in a larger context of investigation. The materials provided currently that reflect the 2013 framework require teachers to completely rearrange and piece components together to create a program that somewhat resembles the direction that we should be going in mathematics education. These key changes in the materials that will result from the new proposed framework will make the job of teachers so much easier. In conclusion, the new California math framework addresses the pressing needs of elementary students and promotes equity in mathematics education. Its comprehensive approach, coupled with specific guidance, provides me as a math coach with a valuable tool to support teachers in transforming the math experience of their students. The framework's ability to answer questions that were previously unanswered by the previous framework will undoubtedly lead to improved student outcomes and a more equitable mathematics education system. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I encourage the State Board of Education to adopt the new California math framework for the benefit of all students across the state. Sincerely, Stephanie Holloway Elementary Math Coach California Mathematics CFCC " -1	"The CMF is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math. Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." -1	"Please do NOT adopt the draft framework.

If you want to get it right, you should have mathematicians who teach university level mathematics writing the next revision. I am further troubled that Boaler appears to have a conflict of interest in recommending measures that lack evidence, and promote her own books and curricula. Please do not adopt the CMF as it stands.  Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with "Big Ideas" aligned to 4 "Content Connections" which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the "big ideas" will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students (especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards ill-defined and vague "big ideas" which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered. A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: "This framework serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013." (Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly FAILED to do its job. In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you to reject recommends teaching "Big Ideas" as the content (see evidence below). Who decided the "big ideas" should replace the content standards (which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD's in MATHEMATICS and which were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)? According to the CMF, three individuals determined the "big ideas" for California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468 we read, "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following." Who are "Boaler, Munson and Williams" who apparently have the authority to determine what students in California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics). NONE of the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where "big ideas" created by non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce; the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers. Additionally, the CMF tells us these "big ideas" (chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of big ideas. "It should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation. Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas." (Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in California. Why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students' fate or allowing grade level teams (who typically involve teachers without math degrees) to decide what "big ideas" their students will learn. This will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation. Furthermore, in reading the CMF it is noted that the "big ideas" originated during distance learning. "So a focused set of big ideas, indicated as Big Ideas, was created as part of the California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance initiative (CDE, 2021). These grade level Big Ideas, organized by Content Connections, and inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards, are presented in the grade-banded chapters, 6, 7, and 8." (Ch 13 line 545). Note the use of the phrase "inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards"; why not ALL content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers? Evidence that the CMF wants to REPLACE Math Content Standards with their "Big Ideas" _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 6 line 228) _ "The foundational mathematics contentÑthat is, the big ideas' (Ch 6 line 942) _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 7 line 165) _ Teachers should be "Teaching from big ideas, not individual standards." (Ch 10 line 177) _ "Educators of pre-service teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authentic-context, big-idea-based instruction described in this framework." (Ch 10, line 247). So the "big ideas" proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past! This replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design, publishers, Teacher Preparation Programs, and grading as well. _ "This framework reflects a revised approach, advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas." (Ch 1 Line 405) _ "To help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep, active learning of mathematics for all students, this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs." (Ch 1 Line 50) _ "Planning teaching around big ideas, the first component of equitable, engaging teaching, lays the groundwork for enacting the other four." (Ch 1 line 361) _ "Design class activities around big ideas, with an emphasis on investigations and connections, not individual standards.' (Ch 1 line 590) _ "In the classroom, teachers teach the big ideas by designing instruction around student investigations of intriguing, authentic experiences relevant to students' grade level, backgrounds, and interests." (Ch 6 line 235) _ "These include designing lessons from a small number of big ideas in each grade band; spending a preponderance of student time on authentic problems that engage multiple content and practice standards situated within one or more big ideas; focusing on connections, to students' lives and among mathematical ideas; and using strategies that show connections between different mathematical ideas on various topics across grade levels." (Ch 10 line 789) _ "Instructional materials should primarily involve tasks that invite students to make sense of these big ideas, elicit wondering in authentic contexts, and necessitate mathematical 2 investigation. Big ideas in math are central to the learning of mathematics, link numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole, and provide focal points for students' investigations. An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. For example, environmental observations and issues on campus and in students' local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis. Such discussions will concurrently help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 8 line 147) _ "Mastery-based grading describes a form of grading that focuses on mastery of ideas rather than on points or scores. This approach is sometimes referred to as standards-based grading, and although it refers to standards, it does not have to focus on specific standards. It could, instead, use cluster headings, which are more akin to the Content Connections and Big Ideas approach of this framework." Ch 12 line 606 Note that not EVEN ONCE are the Math Content Standards Written out anywhere in the over 17,000 lines of text. How can the SBE adopt a CA math framework that does not even list the content standards students are supposed to learn? The math content standards were written in a logical order. As the CMF accurately notes, "California's mathematics content standards were built on progressions of topics across grade levels, informed by both research on children's cognitive development and by the logical structure of mathematics." (Ch 6 line 982). Later on we read, "The Common Core State Standards are based on an understanding of how young people typically develop mathematical knowledge and skills in a sequenced." (Ch 3 line 41) So why would the SBE adopt a CA math framework that recommends we shift away from this logical structure that is sequenced and built on research towards a single interpretation of "big ideas"? As Chapter 5 line 507 states, "As readers consider the three subsequent chapters of the framework, they will see ideas similar to the ones discussed in this chapter, organized to help them learn about and begin to use the big ideas approach. While the transition between standards domains and progressions discussed in this chapter and this new approach will not be straightforward for classroom teachers, both emphasize the central idea that students at all levels should have experiences that build their mathematical toolkits for making sense of their worlds." So the CMF is clearly suggesting a "transition" from standards domains and progression (those research based, logical, sequenced standards) to a "new" approach (big ideas) that will not be straightforward. This is not an experiment I want performed on CA public school students. We also read in Chapter 1 line 369, "To reach the goal of deep, active learning of mathematics for all, this framework encourages a shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction (see box). It instead encourages teachers to think about TKÐ12 math as a series of big ideas." What evidence is there to make these major shifts? In Chapter 2, line 287 the CMF states, "Rather than focusing on specific procedures and memorization, instruction is more effective when teachers aim to develop understanding of bigger ideas and procedures." What study do they cite to support this claim? NONE. The CMF is now making changes to instruction away from the standards based instruction California has implemented for over 26 years without ANY EVIDENCE. There are a number of major concerns (beyond the background of who wrote the big ideas and the lack of evidence they will help students become proficient in math, and the fact that one interpretation of this will replace standards based instruction. 1. The CA Common Core Standards for Math were written such that some standards were designated as "Major" and others were designated as "additional" or "supporting". It is 3 explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations) ,an, ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The CMF proposes that teachers "organize early-grade instruction around the Content Connections, which connect the mathematical big ideas." (Ch 6 line 153).The 4 Content Connections, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? How will it help students achieve proficiency in math and be competitive for STEM careers? As noted previously, the CMF proposed a "shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction." On what evidence and research is this proposed? The authors of the CA Math Content standards (which this CMF proposed replacing with big ideas) surely had and used evidence as they wrote standards and noted which were major. 2. Based upon what is written in the CMF (and the fact that the math content standards are NEVER listed or written out anywhere in the 14 chapters + 3 appendices), there is no reason to believe teachers will even address most of the content standards if they implement this CMF. _ The language of the CMF reveals not all standards will be addressed and further shows a lack of knowledge of the standards by the authors of the CMF. i. The CMF makes statements about instances when teachers might touch "multiple standards". "These chapters illustrate this framework's approach to instructional design by focusing on several big ideas that have great impact on students' conceptual understanding of numbers and that also encompass multiple content standards." (Ch 1 line 1699) Again in Chapter 8, line 922 we read, "As students explore and investigate with the Big Ideas, they will likely encounter many different content standards." ii. In another example, Chapter 3 line 812, we read about what teaching big ideas looks like in a classroom. The CMF states, "Students need time and opportunity to collaborate, critique, and reason about where to place the numbers on the number line (SMP.2, 3). For example, where might 4/7 be placed in relation to 1Ú2." This is great, but the problem is that this is describing a grade 5 classroom and the standards come from grade 4. Again, this gives the public no confidence that the authors of the CMF even know the content standards; further, this does not give the public confidence that our students, if the CMF is adopted, will have a chance to learn them. iii. In another example we read, "In sixth grade, students are introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers." (Ch 3 line 1302). Students are actually introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers in 4 BOTH the grades 3 & 4 content standards. Again I ask, do the authors of the CMF know the content standards? iv. In yet another example, the CMF states, "For example, content standard 4.NF.2 (compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators) may be addressed during an investigation in which students reason with data (CC1) and the same standard might also be addressed by lessons in which students take wholes apart and/or put parts together (CC3)." (Ch 6 line 301/431) This does not sound logical and well thought out but relies on when teachers "might" do math; given CA students' dire performance in math, we can not adopt a framework that has opportunities to possibly learn specific math. _ There are CONTENT STANDARDS MISSING from the "big idea" tables. While the CMF never tries to write out all the math content standards, it does attempt to at least list a standard number next to each big idea. However, in doing this, they SKIPPED 3 standards. The revision process of this third version of the CMF has lasted over a year and not one author can notice that 3 standards are missing? That is unacceptable! i. TK is missing NS 2.4: Solve simple addition and subtraction problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting. ii. Grade 2 is missing NBT 4: Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. iii. Grade 6 is missing EE 8: Write an inequality of the form x>c or x>c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x>c or x<c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams. iv. When a standard is written out, it is partially written out which is very misleading to an elementary teacher who has multiple subjects to teach and cannot be expected to memorize all the math standards. For example grade 3 notes the standard "Categorize shapes by attributes and recognize that different shapes may share certain attributes." (3.G.1) Unfortunately they left out the specific shape names listed in the actual standard (which include rhombus, parallelogram square and rectangle) so a grade 3 teacher reading the framework is likely to work on all shapes as opposed to the specific and narrow focus on quadrilaterals as called out in the content standards. _ Apparently to defend choosing not to write out the math content standards, the CMF argues "Given educators' more-advanced understanding of the individual standards, this framework focuses on connections between standards" (Ch 1 line 809) What about new teachers or those who switch grade levels? They surely don't know the standards. The CMF is happy to list the standards for 5 mathematical practice MULTIPLE times (e.g, Ch 4 line 378), so why can't we adopt a CMF that at least lists the math CONTENT standards once? 3. Examples of how to teach the "big ideas" through "content connections" reveal a clear lack of math knowledge of the writers of the CMF and give the public reason for concern if this CMF is implemented. Following are some specific examples of bizarre and illogical associations. _ Grade 2: "Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them." is listed under the big idea "Represent Data" How is cutting a rectangle "data"? _ Grade 2 MD 5 "Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem." This standard is listed under the big idea "Dollars and cents" How is "length" listed under dollars and cents? _ Grade 4: NBT 3 "Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place," and NBT 4 "Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm." These are both listed under the big idea of "Shapes and Symmetry", defined as "Draw and identify shapes, looking at the relationships between rays, lines, and angles. Explore symmetry through folding activities." _ Grade 5: "NF 4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. a. Interpret the product (a/b) _ q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of operations a _ q Ö b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) _ 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do the same with (2/3) _ (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) _ (c/d) = ac/bd.) b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas. 5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by: a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication. b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given number (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b = (n _ a)/(n _ b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1. 7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) Ö 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) Ö 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) _ 4 = 1/3. b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for 4 Ö (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 Ö (1/5) = 20 because 20 _ (1/5) = 4. c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to 6 represent the problem." Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! _ Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 4. An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, 7 students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? 5. The authors of the CMF clearly see their "big ideas" as rivals of the math content standards. _ We read, "Chapters 6, 7, and 8 set out an approach to mathematics teaching through big ideas that integrates mathematical content and practices instead of narrow procedures." (Ch 12 line 92). Why are the math content standards (which were written to reflect a BALANCE of conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency and application) now being called "narrow procedures"? _ In a sample rubric to help assess students, we read, "Student Strength: What does the student understand in terms of this standard? What linguistic and cultural assets possessed by the students can I tap into to support all students, including those on the road to English proficiency, in their mastery of the content? Student Area for Growth: What should the student focus on to strengthen their understanding of this standard? (Ch 12 line 112) This sounds like we're back to standards based assessment; the only problem is there are NO content standards listed; just "big ideas". The CMF is conflating their "big ideas" with "content standards" Textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed. _ To be eligible for adoption, programs must include a well-defined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards (Ch 13 line 239) _ Materials that fail to meet all of the criteria in category 1 (Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards) will not be considered suitable for adoption. (Ch 13 line 246) _ Instructional materials, as defined in EC Section 60010(h), must be aligned to the CA CCSSM Content Standards and SMPs, adopted by the SBE in August 2010 and modified in January 2013. (Ch 13 line 257) SBE, please hold the CMF to the SAME standard that the state of CA holds publisher to and require the CMF to address and list all math content standards. Do not allow three individuals of which 1 holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and none hold masters or doctoral degrees in mathematics to determine what students will learn in CA public schools. The 2013 CA Common Core Content Standards for math were well written, written by experts with authority and written based upon research about how children learn math. The 2013 CA Math framework did an exceptional job describing what those standards look like and what it means for students to master those. Please REJECT this CMF and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which has much greater promise of helping all students achieve in California." -1	Please see my attached letter. -1	"lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors " -1	"we must keep accelerated math options to all students; we must also prepare students for UC math requirements and retain tried and true math curriculum; common core practices has failed our students and needs to be reigned in " -1	"I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. If the CMF vision is implemented, our Black and Brown students will suffer the most. It is well known that being proficient in mathematics is a strong indicator of later economic success in life, and yet, Black or African American and Brown (Latino or Hispanic) students in California are failing math at historic rates. Black or African American students are down to 16% proficient or advanced on CAASPP in 2021-22 from their high of 21% in 2019, and Latino or Hispanic students are down to 21% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 from their high of 28% in 2019. (Ch 2, line 54). The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to make progress in Math. Furthermore, it is disheartening to have California consider a framework that holds back students who are talented in mathematics and are ready to take Calculus in high school. It is inconceivable to imagine a similar framework proposed for young students who are talented in soccer, that will never happen because young students who are talented in soccer need to join teams that can further their talent. Same thing applies to Mathematics. Why is California proposing a framework that will hurt our most talented Mathematicians? Thank you for your consideration, Erika Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"Lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate".

Dear Members of the State Board of Education, On behalf of Just Equations, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools (Mathematics Framework). If implemented effectively, the framework will support increasing math opportunity for California students, including enabling more underrepresented students to deepen their mathematical proficiency and take advanced math courses. In addition to comments we submittedÑin conjunction with other education advocacy and research organizationsÑsupporting adoption of the framework, we would like to express specific support for the following recommendations: ¥ The adoption of culturally responsive teaching strategies to broaden engagement with mathematical depth and address the need to enhance equity in mathematics learning and achievement. ¥ A balanced approach to acceleration to provide equitable access to higher- level mathematicsÑincluding entry points in middle school and high schoolÑ where appropriate without rushing students through curricula absent a chance to master the content (which contributes to learning declines), as recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Just Equations | Oakland, CA 94612 | info@justequations.org 1 ¥ The integration of data science/literacy as a continuum throughout the curriculum and the addition of high school data science options, which expand opportunities for students and address parental demands for more relevant math courses. ¥ Recognition of the importance of expanding access to calculus courses for students preparing to major in STEM fields. In tandem with the framework, we believe further steps are necessary to ensure equitable math opportunity in California: 1. A minimum graduation requirement of three years of mathematics to replace the current state requirement of two years, ensure all students are learning mathematics through the majority of their high school years, and minimize disparities in mathematics access across schools. 2. Data collection and analysis to monitor and respond to racial and ethnic disparities in middle school and high school math coursetaking (within and across schools), including with respect to implementation of the Math Placement Act of 2015. 3. Further investigation of strategies to address the patterns of math course tracking by raceÑincluding strengthening counselor and family awareness of advanced course opportunitiesÑand elevation of those approaches that prove most successful. 4. Longitudinal research into outcomes of students in various third and fourth year math courses to understand the relationships between various courses and students' postsecondary outcomes and further address concerns raised about newer course options.

" -1	I strongly oppose! -1	"The CMF is more concerned with students feeling "positive" about math than they are about students learning math Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. California students have declined in math proficiency as measured by the CAASPP, down to 33.38% proficient or advanced in 2021-22 (down from about 40% proficient or advanced in 2018-19) (CMF Chp. 2, line 46). On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." -1	"The lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM majors and the most disadvantaged students will be impacted the most. Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"I am a public school graduate from a high school ranked in the 98th percentile in the country, with 56% people of color (https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/massachusetts/districts/lexington/lexington-high-school-9414 [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/massachusetts/districts/lexington/lexington-high-school-9414__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!YCDpMMj3o9mNG5HUosOGW5Z4Jkc8JsEZ2YuNDhi0Lt_zvxvoiIDznIBpvdkWhH1Yza0RfpibZ5Dx_9cTYD3Y7yQNlEQ$]).

On the National Assessment (NAEP), California students have also declined, with only 30% of 4th graders proficient or above in 2022 (down from 34% in 2019) (link) and only 23% of grade 8 students proficient or advanced in 2022 (down from 29% in 2019) (link). So what are California's plans to remedy this massive problem? While there should be a focus on proven interventions such as tutoring and intervention courses, this proposed CMF is more concerned with students feeling positive about math than they are about students learning math. A simple search of language used in the CMF reveals the primary focus of this math framework is NOT on learning math content standards, but rather on helping kids feel good about math. The word "identity" (in reference to building up students' math identities to feel positive about the subject) appears 25 times. The word "belonging" (in that students feel a sense of belonging to the math community) appears 18 times. Contrast that with how many times helping students achieve math "proficiency" is mentioned- ONLY 11 TIMES! No reasonable adult is against students feeling good about math, but that feeling comes as a consequence of reaching proficiency and mastering math content, not as the primary goal of a math teacher. Following are specific examples of the over-emphasis on students feeling good at math at the expense of increasing math content proficiency. _ "This framework offers ideas for teaching in ways that create space for students with a wide range of social identities to access mathematical ideas and feel a sense of belonging to the mathematics community." (Ch. 2, Line 192) _ "Both mathematics educators and mathematics education researchers argue that teaching toward social justice can play an important role in shifting students' perspectives on mathematics as well as their sense of belonging as mathematics thinkers." (Ch. 2, Line 462) _ "This concept is about building positive mathematical identities, beginning at the pre-kindergarten level." (Ch 2, Line 467) _ "Teaching in culturally responsive ways that acknowledge and draw on students' backgrounds, histories, and funds of knowledge enable students to feel a sense of belonging." (Ch 2, Line 499) _ "Teachers can create opportunities for themselves and their students to share autobiographies as mathematics doers and learners, thereby creating spaces for students to participate as authors of their mathematical learning experiences." (Ch 2, Line 514) 1 _ "They strengthen their identities as members of the mathematics community." (Ch 2, Line 792) _ "A classroom that welcomes students' unfinished thinking normalizes mathematical struggle as part of learning and positions all learners as belonging to the discipline of mathematics." (Ch 2, Line 871) _ "The aim is to have students come to view mathematics as a subject that is about sense making and reasoning, to which they can contribute and belong." (Ch 2, Line 988) _ "Data investigation can support teachers as they seek to create climates of belonging for students, inviting them to investigate real data that is likely relevant to their lives." (Ch 5, Line 123) _ "Educators can offer social and emotional support to students by designing engaging lessons that allow students to connect in meaningful ways with content." (Ch 5, Line 1400) _ "Important principles underlying the teaching of data science that will offer the greatest chance for social, emotional, and academic development include the following: _ Convey Mindset and Belonging Messages." (Ch 5, Line 1409) _ "This framework is intended to help teachers ensure that the math experiences of all their students are positive "(Ch 7 Line 68) _ "The idea is for teachers to help students experience the "wonder, joy, and beauty of math" (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and help students develop and sustain a positive identity as capable mathematics learners." (Ch 7, Line 72) _ "When students are engaged in meaningful, investigative experiences, they can come to view mathematics, and their own relationship to mathematics, far more positively." (Ch 2 line 164) All stakeholders would want students to view their relationship to math positively, but that can NOT be the primary goal of math instruction. As a state, for the sake of our future, we MUST focus on increasing math proficiency, even if that means students sometimes feel like they are not good at math. The CMF advises teachers, "During groupwork, the teacher looks for opportunities to elevate students by highlighting their abilities and contributions to the group, which is referred to as "assigning competence". (Ch 12, line 244) What California needs is not "assigned competence" but "actual competence" which is often achieved by hard work and sometimes failing so that one works harder to learn and succeed. The CMF further explains, "When teachers perceive that a student has become "low status" in a group, they intervene by publicly praising a mathematical contribution the student has made." (Ch 12, Line 248). If a pilot nearly causes a plane to crash, is the boss going to point out that he had a nice takeoff? Status 2 is often achieved because it has been earned and ideas are valued and respected, not because someone intervenes to praise something that person did in the past. The CMF continues in this vein, writing "but grouping by perceived "ability" can be the first step in a system of tracking if "similar ability" students are grouped together (see chapter nine) or can unintentionally communicate beliefs about who is capableÑas when groups are intentionally stratified according to perceived "ability" so that students soon understand who is the "high kid" and who is the "low kid" in the group. Aside from language development considerations and any safety concerns, randomizing group assignments can convey to each student that everyone has something to offer the group's learning and something to learn from the thoughts of others." (Ch 4, Line 512). Students know who the "high kids" are in math regardless if the teacher puts them in a special group. The CMF is so concerned about students feeling good about themselves, the authors are willing to sacrifice allowing our most advanced learners' acceleration needed to become the STEM professionals that power our world. Of course putting more advanced math students in a group communicates who is most capable at that point; over 70% of California students are below proficient; everyone knows that! Let's not hide that and pretend all students are on equal footing; rather, let's put struggling students into groups and provide extra support so they CAN become proficient. In addition to an overemphasis on feeling good about math in the place of achieving proficiency in math, the CMF puts self-esteem and not feeling anxious as other primary goals. The CMF claims (without any supporting evidence) "Students also self-select out when mathematics is experienced as the memorization of meaningless formulasÑperhaps because they see no relevance for their learning and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics." (Ch 1, Line 248). Isn't it possible that some self-select out of math when it gets too hard, just like nearly everything else in life students self-select out of (even if it's fun and engaging), such as little league, boy scouts, dance, music, etc. The authors also write, "Other research examines beliefs and attitudes such as utility value (belief that mathematics is relevant to personal goals and to societal problems), and this research shows a severe drop off in utility value during high school." (Ch 8 Line 612). Of course many things we ask students to learn in high school have a drop off in utility; what happened to the attitude of there just being some things you need to learn and perhaps you'll see relevance or apply them later in life; e.g. many students don't care about credit or loans when they 15 years old, but if they learn the math behind finance, they will be very thankful of its utility later in life. The state of California has set our content STANDARDS in math. That is what students MUST learn, whether or not they see "utility" in it. The same is true in reading, writing, and all academic courses required for graduation. The CMF needs to focus on students mastering math content standards!!! The CMF is so concerned with how students feel, the authors have forgotten the primary goal of math education- to learn math! In addition to the focus on math teachers needing to build student self-esteem, the CMF proposes that exams be changed to help with student feelings. Chapter 12 Line 854 reads, "Summative assessments have the potential to be anxiety-inducing for students, so some best practices should be implemented to minimize damaging effects." Most every challenging thing in life is anxiety inducing, so what is the CMF preparing students for? A world where they are 3 not competent (proficient) and yet everyone praises them for anything they say or do at all so they feel good about themselves? California is in a dire situation in terms of student math proficiency, especially with socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Students are in need of rigorous and proven methods that focus on students' math proficiency levels; rather than guide educators and stakeholders towards this end, the CMF is more concerned with how students feel about math, helping them "belong" to the math community (whatever that means), and helping them develop a "positive math identity". Your job as an SBE is clear: REJECT this framework and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which focuses on math content standards, learning, teaching and assessment as its primary focus." -1	"The California math framework needs to plan to offer Algebra in middle school to every student who is ready for it. Failing to have this as an integral part of the math framework widens the socioeconomic gaps and opportunities among our California students and citizens. " -1	"Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with "Big Ideas" aligned to 4 "Content Connections" which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the "big ideas" will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students (especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards ill-defined and vague "big ideas" which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered. A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: "This framework serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013." (Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly FAILED to do its job. In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you to reject recommends teaching "Big Ideas" as the content (see evidence below). Who decided the "big ideas" should replace the content standards (which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD's in MATHEMATICS and which were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)? According to the CMF, three individuals determined the "big ideas" for California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468 we read, "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following." Who are "Boaler, Munson and Williams" who apparently have the authority to determine what students in California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics). NONE of the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where "big ideas" created by non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce; the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers. Additionally, the CMF tells us these "big ideas" (chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of big ideas. "It should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation. Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas." (Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting.

(Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in California. Why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students' fate or allowing grade level teams (who typically involve teachers without math degrees) to decide what "big ideas" their students will learn. This will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation. Furthermore, in reading the CMF it is noted that the "big ideas" originated during distance learning. "So a focused set of big ideas, indicated as Big Ideas, was created as part of the California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance initiative (CDE, 2021). These grade level Big Ideas, organized by Content Connections, and inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards, are presented in the grade-banded chapters, 6, 7, and 8." (Ch 13 line 545). Note the use of the phrase "inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards"; why not ALL content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers? Evidence that the CMF wants to REPLACE Math Content Standards with their "Big Ideas" _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 6 line 228) _ "The foundational mathematics contentÑthat is, the big ideas' (Ch 6 line 942) _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 7 line 165) _ Teachers should be "Teaching from big ideas, not individual standards." (Ch 10 line 177) _ "Educators of pre-service teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authentic-context, big-idea-based instruction described in this framework." (Ch 10, line 247). So the "big ideas" proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past! This replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design, publishers, Teacher Preparation Programs, and grading as well. _ "This framework reflects a revised approach, advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas." (Ch 1 Line 405) _ "To help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep, active learning of mathematics for all students, this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs." (Ch 1 Line 50) _ "Planning teaching around big ideas, the first component of equitable, engaging teaching, lays the groundwork for enacting the other four." (Ch 1 line 361) _ "Design class activities around big ideas, with an emphasis on investigations and connections, not individual standards.' (Ch 1 line 590) _ "In the classroom, teachers teach the big ideas by designing instruction around student investigations of intriguing, authentic experiences relevant to students' grade level, backgrounds, and interests." (Ch 6 line 235) _ "These include designing lessons from a small number of big ideas in each grade band; spending a preponderance of student time on authentic problems that engage multiple content and practice standards situated within one or more big ideas; focusing on connections, to students' lives and among mathematical ideas; and using strategies that show connections between different mathematical ideas on various topics across grade levels." (Ch 10 line 789) _ "Instructional materials should primarily involve tasks that invite students to make sense of these big ideas, elicit wondering in authentic contexts, and necessitate mathematical 2 investigation. Big ideas in math are central to the learning of mathematics, link numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole, and provide focal points for students' investigations. An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. For example, environmental observations and issues on campus and in students' local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis. Such discussions will concurrently help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 8 line 147) _ "Mastery-based grading describes a form of grading that focuses on mastery of ideas rather than on points or scores. This approach is sometimes referred to as standards-based grading, and although it refers to standards, it does not have to focus on specific standards. It could, instead, use cluster headings, which are more akin to the Content Connections and Big Ideas approach of this framework." Ch 12 line 606 Note that not EVEN ONCE are the Math Content Standards Written out anywhere in the over 17,000 lines of text. How can the SBE adopt a CA math framework that does not even list the content standards students are supposed to learn? The math content standards were written in a logical order. As the CMF accurately notes, "California's mathematics content standards were built on progressions of topics across grade levels, informed by both research on children's cognitive development and by the logical structure of mathematics." (Ch 6 line 982). Later on we read, "The Common Core State Standards are based on an understanding of how young people typically develop mathematical knowledge and skills in a sequenced." (Ch 3 line 41) So why would the SBE adopt a CA math framework that recommends we shift away from this logical structure that is sequenced and built on research towards a single interpretation of "big ideas"? As Chapter 5 line 507 states, "As readers consider the three subsequent chapters of the framework, they will see ideas similar to the ones discussed in this chapter, organized to help them learn about and begin to use the big ideas approach. While the transition between standards domains and progressions discussed in this chapter and this new approach will not be straightforward for classroom teachers, both emphasize the central idea that students at all levels should have experiences that build their mathematical toolkits for making sense of their worlds." So the CMF is clearly suggesting a "transition" from standards domains and progression (those research based, logical, sequenced standards) to a "new" approach (big ideas) that will not be straightforward. This is not an experiment I want performed on CA public school students. We also read in Chapter 1 line 369, "To reach the goal of deep, active learning of mathematics for all, this framework encourages a shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction (see box). It instead encourages teachers to think about TKÐ12 math as a series of big ideas." What evidence is there to make these major shifts? In Chapter 2, line 287 the CMF states, "Rather than focusing on specific procedures and memorization, instruction is more effective when teachers aim to develop understanding of bigger ideas and procedures." What study do they cite to support this claim? NONE. The CMF is now making changes to instruction away from the standards based instruction California has implemented for over 26 years without ANY EVIDENCE. There are a number of major concerns (beyond the background of who wrote the big ideas and the lack of evidence they will help students become proficient in math, and the fact that one interpretation of this will replace standards based instruction. 1. The CA Common Core Standards for Math were written such that some standards were designated as "Major" and others were designated as "additional" or "supporting". It is 3 explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations) ,an, ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The CMF proposes that teachers "organize early-grade instruction around the Content Connections, which connect the mathematical big ideas." (Ch 6 line 153).The 4 Content Connections, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? How will it help students achieve proficiency in math and be competitive for STEM careers? As noted previously, the CMF proposed a "shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction." On what evidence and research is this proposed? The authors of the CA Math Content standards (which this CMF proposed replacing with big ideas) surely had and used evidence as they wrote standards and noted which were major. 2. Based upon what is written in the CMF (and the fact that the math content standards are NEVER listed or written out anywhere in the 14 chapters + 3 appendices), there is no reason to believe teachers will even address most of the content standards if they implement this CMF. _ The language of the CMF reveals not all standards will be addressed and further shows a lack of knowledge of the standards by the authors of the CMF. i. The CMF makes statements about instances when teachers might touch "multiple standards". "These chapters illustrate this framework's approach to instructional design by focusing on several big ideas that have great impact on students' conceptual understanding of numbers and that also encompass multiple content standards." (Ch 1 line 1699) Again in Chapter 8, line 922 we read, "As students explore and investigate with the Big Ideas, they will likely encounter many different content standards." ii. In another example, Chapter 3 line 812, we read about what teaching big ideas looks like in a classroom. The CMF states, "Students need time and opportunity to collaborate, critique, and reason about where to place the numbers on the number line (SMP.2, 3). For example, where might 4/7 be placed in relation to 1Ú2." This is great, but the problem is that this is describing a grade 5 classroom and the standards come from grade 4. Again, this gives the public no confidence that the authors of the CMF even know the content standards; further, this does not give the public confidence that our students, if the CMF is adopted, will have a chance to learn them. iii. In another example we read, "In sixth grade, students are introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers." (Ch 3 line 1302). Students are actually introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers in 4 BOTH the grades 3 & 4 content standards. Again I ask, do the authors of the CMF know the content standards? iv. In yet another example, the CMF states, "For example, content standard 4.NF.2 (compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators) may be addressed during an investigation in which students reason with data (CC1) and the same standard might also be addressed by lessons in which students take wholes apart and/or put parts together (CC3)." (Ch 6 line 301/431) This does not sound logical and well thought out but relies on when teachers "might" do math; given CA students' dire performance in math, we can not adopt a framework that has opportunities to possibly learn specific math. _ There are CONTENT STANDARDS MISSING from the "big idea" tables. While the CMF never tries to write out all the math content standards, it does attempt to at least list a standard number next to each big idea. However, in doing this, they SKIPPED 3 standards. The revision process of this third version of the CMF has lasted over a year and not one author can notice that 3 standards are missing? That is unacceptable! i. TK is missing NS 2.4: Solve simple addition and subtraction problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting. ii. Grade 2 is missing NBT 4: Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. iii. Grade 6 is missing EE 8: Write an inequality of the form x>c or x>c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x>c or x<c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams. iv. When a standard is written out, it is partially written out which is very misleading to an elementary teacher who has multiple subjects to teach and cannot be expected to memorize all the math standards. For example grade 3 notes the standard "Categorize shapes by attributes and recognize that different shapes may share certain attributes." (3.G.1) Unfortunately they left out the specific shape names listed in the actual standard (which include rhombus, parallelogram square and rectangle) so a grade 3 teacher reading the framework is likely to work on all shapes as opposed to the specific and narrow focus on quadrilaterals as called out in the content standards. _ Apparently to defend choosing not to write out the math content standards, the CMF argues "Given educators' more-advanced understanding of the individual standards, this framework focuses on connections between standards" (Ch 1 line 809) What about new teachers or those who switch grade levels? They surely don't know the standards. The CMF is happy to list the standards for 5 mathematical practice MULTIPLE times (e.g, Ch 4 line 378), so why can't we adopt a CMF that at least lists the math CONTENT standards once? 3. Examples of how to teach the "big ideas" through "content connections" reveal a clear lack of math knowledge of the writers of the CMF and give the public reason for concern if this CMF is implemented. Following are some specific examples of bizarre and illogical associations. _ Grade 2: "Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them." is listed under the big idea "Represent Data" How is cutting a rectangle "data"? _ Grade 2 MD 5 "Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem." This standard is listed under the big idea "Dollars and cents" How is "length" listed under dollars and cents? _ Grade 4: NBT 3 "Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place," and NBT 4 "Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm." These are both listed under the big idea of "Shapes and Symmetry", defined as "Draw and identify shapes, looking at the relationships between rays, lines, and angles. Explore symmetry through folding activities." _ Grade 5: "NF 4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. a. Interpret the product (a/b) _ q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of operations a _ q Ö b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) _ 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do the same with (2/3) _ (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) _ (c/d) = ac/bd.) b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas. 5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by: a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication. b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given number (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b = (n _ a)/(n _ b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1. 7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) Ö 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) Ö 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) _ 4 = 1/3. b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for 4 Ö (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 Ö (1/5) = 20 because 20 _ (1/5) = 4. c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to 6 represent the problem." Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! _ Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 4. An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, 7 students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? 5. The authors of the CMF clearly see their "big ideas" as rivals of the math content standards. _ We read, "Chapters 6, 7, and 8 set out an approach to mathematics teaching through big ideas that integrates mathematical content and practices instead of narrow procedures." (Ch 12 line 92). Why are the math content standards (which were written to reflect a BALANCE of conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency and application) now being called "narrow procedures"? _ In a sample rubric to help assess students, we read, "Student Strength: What does the student understand in terms of this standard? What linguistic and cultural assets possessed by the students can I tap into to support all students, including those on the road to English proficiency, in their mastery of the content? Student Area for Growth: What should the student focus on to strengthen their understanding of this standard? (Ch 12 line 112) This sounds like we're back to standards based assessment; the only problem is there are NO content standards listed; just "big ideas". The CMF is conflating their "big ideas" with "content standards" Textbook publishers are required to ensure content standards are all addressed. _ To be eligible for adoption, programs must include a well-defined sequence of instructional opportunities that provides a path for all students to become proficient in the standards (Ch 13 line 239) _ Materials that fail to meet all of the criteria in category 1 (Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards) will not be considered suitable for adoption. (Ch 13 line 246) _ Instructional materials, as defined in EC Section 60010(h), must be aligned to the CA CCSSM Content Standards and SMPs, adopted by the SBE in August 2010 and modified in January 2013. (Ch 13 line 257) SBE, please hold the CMF to the SAME standard that the state of CA holds publisher to and require the CMF to address and list all math content standards. Do not allow three individuals of which 1 holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and none hold masters or doctoral degrees in mathematics to determine what students will learn in CA public schools. The 2013 CA Common Core Content Standards for math were well written, written by experts with authority and written based upon research about how children learn math. The 2013 CA Math framework did an exceptional job describing what those standards look like and what it means for students to master those. Please REJECT this CMF and go back to the 2013 CA Math Framework which has much greater promise of helping all students achieve in California." -1	"Math Content Standards are being replaced by 'big ideas' not written by mathematicians Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the July 12-13, 2023 meeting. In the CMF, the adopted California Common Core Content Standards are being replaced with "Big Ideas" aligned to 4 "Content Connections" which were not vetted, shared with the CA public nor written by people with advanced math degrees; the there is no evidence the "big ideas" will prepare our students for success in mathematics. The SBE needs to require that a California Math Framework focus on the Math Content Standards adopted by the state of California. The proposed CMF will fail students (especially struggling students) as it shifts away from standards-based instruction where students learned specific concepts and skills towards ill-defined and vague "big ideas" which have no guarantee of ensuring topics required for success in math are mastered. A California Mathematics Framework has the following goal: "This framework serves as a guide to implementing the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM or the Standards), adopted in 2010 and updated in 2013." (Ch 1 line 37) Yet, only 6.3% of the CMF discusses or even lists specific CA math content standards (1072 lines out of 17,088 lines). The CMF has clearly FAILED to do its job. In direct contrast to the job of a CA Math Framework, the proposed CMF I ask you to reject recommends teaching "Big Ideas" as the content (see evidence below). Who decided the "big ideas" should replace the content standards (which were created primarily by 3 professionals who hold PhD's in MATHEMATICS and which were vetted and voted on in California with public knowledge and input)? According to the CMF, three individuals determined the "big ideas" for California and the CMF. In Chapter 3 line 244 and again in Chapter 3 line 1468 we read, "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018), and "Three big ideas (Boaler, Munson, and Williams, 2018) related to number sense for the high school level call for students to do the following." Who are "Boaler, Munson and Williams" who apparently have the authority to determine what students in California will learn in math? Well, of these three, only 1 holds a degree in mathematics (Cathy Williams has a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics). NONE of the three hold a master in mathematics and NONE of the three hold a PhD in mathematics. SBE- you must reject a framework where "big ideas" created by non-mathematicians are replacing content standards written by mathematicians and vetted by thousands. If not, California will fail to produce a STEM workforce; the decision about what math is to be learned must be left up to those with advanced degrees in mathematics who know what is needed for STEM careers. Additionally, the CMF tells us these "big ideas" (chosen by three individuals without a single advanced math degree) are in fact just ONE interpretation of big ideas. "It should be said that there are many interpretations of big ideas in mathematics, and those presented in these figures are one variation. Providing mathematics teachers with adequate release time to collaborate with colleagues and engage in discussions around their vision of big ideas at their grade level or in a particular course can enable them to create rich, deep tasks that invite students to explore and grapple with those big ideas." (Ch 7 line 952). If this is the case, and big ideas are the way to go instead of standards, why doesn't the SBE put together a group of qualified individuals to 1 draft these and then have them vetted and voted upon in California. Why are we allowing three under qualified individuals to decide our students' fate or allowing grade level teams (who typically involve teachers without math degrees) to decide what "big ideas" their students will learn. This will be a failed experiment with the cost being math proficiency for a generation. Furthermore, in reading the CMF it is noted that the "big ideas" originated during distance learning. "So a focused set of big ideas, indicated as Big Ideas, was created as part of the California Digital Learning Integration and Standards Guidance initiative (CDE, 2021). These grade level Big Ideas, organized by Content Connections, and inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards, are presented in the grade-banded chapters, 6, 7, and 8." (Ch 13 line 545). Note the use of the phrase "inclusive of multiple CA CCSSM content standards"; why not ALL content standards if teaching standards based mathematics if the job of a public school teachers? Evidence that the CMF wants to REPLACE Math Content Standards with their "Big Ideas" _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 6 line 228) _ "The foundational mathematics contentÑthat is, the big ideas' (Ch 6 line 942) _ "In this framework, the big ideas are delineated by grade level and are the core content of each grade." (Ch 7 line 165) _ Teachers should be "Teaching from big ideas, not individual standards." (Ch 10 line 177) _ "Educators of pre-service teachers need to align their programs to reflect the authentic-context, big-idea-based instruction described in this framework." (Ch 10, line 247). So the "big ideas" proposed by 3 individuals without strong math backgrounds will be here to stay and the math content standards will be a thing of the past! This replacement of math content standards as the primary focus applies to lesson design, publishers, Teacher Preparation Programs, and grading as well. _ "This framework reflects a revised approach, advocating that publishers and teachers avoid organizing around the detailed content standards and instead organize around the most important mathematical ideas." (Ch 1 Line 405) _ "To help educators attain the goal of ensuring deep, active learning of mathematics for all students, this framework is centered around the investigation of big ideas in mathematics, connected to each other and to authentic, real world contexts and taught in multidimensional ways that meet varied learning needs." (Ch 1 Line 50) _ "Planning teaching around big ideas, the first component of equitable, engaging teaching, lays the groundwork for enacting the other four." (Ch 1 line 361) _ "Design class activities around big ideas, with an emphasis on investigations and connections, not individual standards.' (Ch 1 line 590) _ "In the classroom, teachers teach the big ideas by designing instruction around student investigations of intriguing, authentic experiences relevant to students' grade level, backgrounds, and interests." (Ch 6 line 235) _ "These include designing lessons from a small number of big ideas in each grade band; spending a preponderance of student time on authentic problems that engage multiple content and practice standards situated within one or more big ideas; focusing on connections, to students' lives and among mathematical ideas; and using strategies that show connections between different mathematical ideas on various topics across grade levels." (Ch 10 line 789) _ "Instructional materials should primarily involve tasks that invite students to make sense of these big ideas, elicit wondering in authentic contexts, and necessitate mathematical 2 investigation. Big ideas in math are central to the learning of mathematics, link numerous mathematical understandings into a coherent whole, and provide focal points for students' investigations. An authentic activity or problem is one in which students investigate or struggle with situations or questions about which they actually wonder. Lesson design should be built to elicit that wondering. For example, environmental observations and issues on campus and in students' local community provide rich contexts for student investigations and mathematical analysis. Such discussions will concurrently help students develop their understanding of California's Environmental Principles and Concepts." (Ch 8 line 147) _ "Mastery-based grading describes a form of grading that focuses on mastery of ideas rather than on points or scores. This approach is sometimes referred to as standards-based grading, and although it refers to standards, it does not have to focus on specific standards. It could, instead, use cluster headings, which are more akin to the Content Connections and Big Ideas approach of this framework." Ch 12 line 606 Note that not EVEN ONCE are the Math Content Standards Written out anywhere in the over 17,000 lines of text. How can the SBE adopt a CA math framework that does not even list the content standards students are supposed to learn? The math content standards were written in a logical order. As the CMF accurately notes, "California's mathematics content standards were built on progressions of topics across grade levels, informed by both research on children's cognitive development and by the logical structure of mathematics." (Ch 6 line 982). Later on we read, "The Common Core State Standards are based on an understanding of how young people typically develop mathematical knowledge and skills in a sequenced." (Ch 3 line 41) So why would the SBE adopt a CA math framework that recommends we shift away from this logical structure that is sequenced and built on research towards a single interpretation of "big ideas"? As Chapter 5 line 507 states, "As readers consider the three subsequent chapters of the framework, they will see ideas similar to the ones discussed in this chapter, organized to help them learn about and begin to use the big ideas approach. While the transition between standards domains and progressions discussed in this chapter and this new approach will not be straightforward for classroom teachers, both emphasize the central idea that students at all levels should have experiences that build their mathematical toolkits for making sense of their worlds." So the CMF is clearly suggesting a "transition" from standards domains and progression (those research based, logical, sequenced standards) to a "new" approach (big ideas) that will not be straightforward. This is not an experiment I want performed on CA public school students. We also read in Chapter 1 line 369, "To reach the goal of deep, active learning of mathematics for all, this framework encourages a shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction (see box). It instead encourages teachers to think about TKÐ12 math as a series of big ideas." What evidence is there to make these major shifts? In Chapter 2, line 287 the CMF states, "Rather than focusing on specific procedures and memorization, instruction is more effective when teachers aim to develop understanding of bigger ideas and procedures." What study do they cite to support this claim? NONE. The CMF is now making changes to instruction away from the standards based instruction California has implemented for over 26 years without ANY EVIDENCE. There are a number of major concerns (beyond the background of who wrote the big ideas and the lack of evidence they will help students become proficient in math, and the fact that one interpretation of this will replace standards based instruction. 1. The CA Common Core Standards for Math were written such that some standards were designated as "Major" and others were designated as "additional" or "supporting". It is 3 explained that the additional/supporting standards provide context and opportunities for students to practice and apply what is major, but the learning of those standards is not as important in and of themselves. In all grade levels, K-8 the major work includes all facts and operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals and integers, place value, algebraic thinking (including expressions and equations) ,an, ratios and proportions. Additional or supporting standards include all standards related to data, statistics or probability as well as all standards related to Geometry. The CMF proposes that teachers "organize early-grade instruction around the Content Connections, which connect the mathematical big ideas." (Ch 6 line 153).The 4 Content Connections, which the CMF describe as the "what" of teaching math are as follows: 1) Reasoning with Data; 2) Exploring Changing Quantities; 3) Taking wholes apart, putting wholes together; and 4) Discovering shape and space (Ch 1 Line 457). So two of the four CC's (50%) are topics which the California Common Core Content Standards for Mathematics (as evidenced in the 2013 CA math framework and the SBAC blueprint) are NOT MAJOR WORK of ANY GRADE LEVEL. How will 50% of the "what" of math being focused on standards that are not major support struggling students? How will it help students achieve proficiency in math and be competitive for STEM careers? As noted previously, the CMF proposed a "shift away from the previous approach of identifying the major standards (or "power" standards) as focal points for organizing curriculum and instruction." On what evidence and research is this proposed? The authors of the CA Math Content standards (which this CMF proposed replacing with big ideas) surely had and used evidence as they wrote standards and noted which were major. 2. Based upon what is written in the CMF (and the fact that the math content standards are NEVER listed or written out anywhere in the 14 chapters + 3 appendices), there is no reason to believe teachers will even address most of the content standards if they implement this CMF. _ The language of the CMF reveals not all standards will be addressed and further shows a lack of knowledge of the standards by the authors of the CMF. i. The CMF makes statements about instances when teachers might touch "multiple standards". "These chapters illustrate this framework's approach to instructional design by focusing on several big ideas that have great impact on students' conceptual understanding of numbers and that also encompass multiple content standards." (Ch 1 line 1699) Again in Chapter 8, line 922 we read, "As students explore and investigate with the Big Ideas, they will likely encounter many different content standards." ii. In another example, Chapter 3 line 812, we read about what teaching big ideas looks like in a classroom. The CMF states, "Students need time and opportunity to collaborate, critique, and reason about where to place the numbers on the number line (SMP.2, 3). For example, where might 4/7 be placed in relation to 1Ú2." This is great, but the problem is that this is describing a grade 5 classroom and the standards come from grade 4. Again, this gives the public no confidence that the authors of the CMF even know the content standards; further, this does not give the public confidence that our students, if the CMF is adopted, will have a chance to learn them. iii. In another example we read, "In sixth grade, students are introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers." (Ch 3 line 1302). Students are actually introduced to the idea that letters can stand for numbers in 4 BOTH the grades 3 & 4 content standards. Again I ask, do the authors of the CMF know the content standards? iv. In yet another example, the CMF states, "For example, content standard 4.NF.2 (compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators) may be addressed during an investigation in which students reason with data (CC1) and the same standard might also be addressed by lessons in which students take wholes apart and/or put parts together (CC3)." (Ch 6 line 301/431) This does not sound logical and well thought out but relies on when teachers "might" do math; given CA students' dire performance in math, we can not adopt a framework that has opportunities to possibly learn specific math. _ There are CONTENT STANDARDS MISSING from the "big idea" tables. While the CMF never tries to write out all the math content standards, it does attempt to at least list a standard number next to each big idea. However, in doing this, they SKIPPED 3 standards. The revision process of this third version of the CMF has lasted over a year and not one author can notice that 3 standards are missing? That is unacceptable! i. TK is missing NS 2.4: Solve simple addition and subtraction problems with a small number of objects (sums up to 10), usually by counting. ii. Grade 2 is missing NBT 4: Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons. iii. Grade 6 is missing EE 8: Write an inequality of the form x>c or x>c to represent a constraint or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that inequalities of the form x>c or x<c have infinitely many solutions; represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams. iv. When a standard is written out, it is partially written out which is very misleading to an elementary teacher who has multiple subjects to teach and cannot be expected to memorize all the math standards. For example grade 3 notes the standard "Categorize shapes by attributes and recognize that different shapes may share certain attributes." (3.G.1) Unfortunately they left out the specific shape names listed in the actual standard (which include rhombus, parallelogram square and rectangle) so a grade 3 teacher reading the framework is likely to work on all shapes as opposed to the specific and narrow focus on quadrilaterals as called out in the content standards. _ Apparently to defend choosing not to write out the math content standards, the CMF argues "Given educators' more-advanced understanding of the individual standards, this framework focuses on connections between standards" (Ch 1 line 809) What about new teachers or those who switch grade levels? They surely don't know the standards. The CMF is happy to list the standards for 5 mathematical practice MULTIPLE times (e.g, Ch 4 line 378), so why can't we adopt a CMF that at least lists the math CONTENT standards once? 3. Examples of how to teach the "big ideas" through "content connections" reveal a clear lack of math knowledge of the writers of the CMF and give the public reason for concern if this CMF is implemented. Following are some specific examples of bizarre and illogical associations. _ Grade 2: "Partition a rectangle into rows and columns of same-size squares and count to find the total number of them." is listed under the big idea "Represent Data" How is cutting a rectangle "data"? _ Grade 2 MD 5 "Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem." This standard is listed under the big idea "Dollars and cents" How is "length" listed under dollars and cents? _ Grade 4: NBT 3 "Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place," and NBT 4 "Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm." These are both listed under the big idea of "Shapes and Symmetry", defined as "Draw and identify shapes, looking at the relationships between rays, lines, and angles. Explore symmetry through folding activities." _ Grade 5: "NF 4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction. a. Interpret the product (a/b) _ q as a parts of a partition of q into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of operations a _ q Ö b. For example, use a visual fraction model to show (2/3) _ 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do the same with (2/3) _ (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) _ (c/d) = ac/bd.) b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas. 5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by: a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication. b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater than 1 results in a product greater than the given number (recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b = (n _ a)/(n _ b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1. 7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1 a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) Ö 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) Ö 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) _ 4 = 1/3. b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for 4 Ö (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 Ö (1/5) = 20 because 20 _ (1/5) = 4. c. Solve real-world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to 6 represent the problem." Guess what "big idea" these standards about multiplying and dividing fractions are found under? Did you guess "Shapes on a Plane"? Neither did I as there is NO connection here!!! _ Algebra I "investigate situations that involve linear, quadratic, and exponential models, and use these models to solve problems. Recognize linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals; exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals, and functions grow or decay by a percentage rate per unit interval. Interpret the inverse of functions, and model the inverse in graphs, tables, and equations." This standard can be found under the content connection of "putting wholes together and taking whole apart". Why would nearly anything in Algebra I fit into the same 4 categories focused on in Kindergarten? Apparently for "consistency" as literally anything is taking the place of a focus on students mastering math content standards. The CMF states (Ch 8 line 77), "For consistency across the entire transitional kindergarten through grade twelve span, the expected understandings, skills, and dispositions of graduates are organized by Content Connection (CC). _ Reasoning with Data (CC1) _ Exploring Changing Quantities (CC2) _ Taking Wholes Apart, Putting Parts Together (CC3) _ Discovering Shape and Space (CC4)." 4. An obsession with "data" has taken over much of the CMF without evidence to support this drastic change. As noted before, "data" has always been "additional or supporting" in the standards and NEVER major. Yet this CMF not only devotes an entire chapter to it, but also makes it 1 of the 4 content connections all big ideas relate to. I can understand the desire for relevance, but then why not focus on Financial Applications (and algebra in secondary). Is it because the two of the authors of the "big ideas" have designed their own data course? This is surely something to be explored by the SBE. _ In Chapter 5 line 231 we read, "there are multiple opportunities to support such data-rich experiences and integrate the five components of equitable and engaging teaching described in chapter two, even if the standards domains do not appear explicitly within a grade or grade band." So teaching data comes BEFORE being concerned about grade level standards? _ Chapter 7 line 514 tells us, "Grades six through eight mathematics courses should give prominence to statistical understanding and reasoning with and about dataÑreflecting the growing importance of data in most mathematical situations that students will encounter in their lives." Again, who is deciding this? Where are the math experts (those with PhD's in math that know what students need to learn for a rigorous math education?) _ There are multiple instances of the CMF describing that teachers could or should do data that involve topics either well above or well below grade level standards This blatant disregard for content standards to focus on "data" is not acceptable. See Ch 5 line 493, Chapter 5 line 561 and Chapter 5 line 604 for examples. _ The focus on data has so clouded the CMF's thinking, they describe activities with virtually no math (which would be ok if CA students were proficient, but since we're far below, math teachers need to teach math content standards). We read, "For example, 7 students may be challenged to discover which location (inside or outside the classroom) has the "best" types of tables for collaborative group work. As a part of this task, students explore the idea of "best" and discuss features such as size of the tabletop, height of the table, and shape. The teacher guides the students to consider which attributes of the table could be measured and then provides a template for student pairs to collect their observations and measurementsÑe.g., of width, height, and shape of the table. After collecting data, students notice that some of the table shapes were hard to measure because of their unexpected shapeÑe.g., trapezoids, kidney beans, and circles." Ch 5 line 700. So students spend all this time to measure something and then note that some things are hard to measure. Is that the rigor we expect in CA schools in grade 5? 5. The authors of the CMF clearly see their "big ideas" as rivals of the math content standards. _ We read, "Chapters 6, 7, and 8 set out an approach to mathematics teaching through big ideas that integrates mathematical content and practices instead of narrow procedures." (Ch 12 line 92). Why are the math content standards (which were written to reflect a BALANCE of conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency and application) now being called "narrow procedures"? _ In a sample rubric to help assess students, we read, "Student Strength: What does the student understand in terms of this standard?

(Ch 12 line 112) This sounds like we're back to standards based assessment; the only problem is there are NO content standards listed; just "big ideas".

California is going to destroy its children for years to come. We urge you to think long and hard about where you go with this, all you are going to be left with are poor kids with poor parents who can't afford to get out of your public schools, so your grades are going to look even worse vs other states and a decline is inevitable. If you want smart kids and smart parents in your public schools, you have to both listen to them and cater to them in an equal amount to those who need lifting up. Holding kids back is morally questionable at best.  " -1	"Due to late release i don't have time to go detail by detail. By just reading chapter names and some of framework, it's obvious that yet again you are setting up the kids of CA to fail at math. There is no 'equity' in math. Ditto inclusive or diversity. Common core was bad enough in making our kids deficient, and this will compound. Memorization of math facts is the key. Why don't you emulate the framework of countries or areas in U. S. that have good math scores. This is truly appalling and should not be adopted.  " -1	"Lack of clear plans to allow students to accelerate before grade 11 will harm STEM Majors. Please see attached.  Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 _ The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). _ The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts 1 _ As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? _ Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. 2 _ In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. _ The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. _ "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how 3 can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? _ Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students _ The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! _ The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. 4 _ The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? _ The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students _ The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) _ The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, [1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. 5 The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. _ In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected." -1	"As a product of California's public school system, having access to coursework that challenged me, energized me, and inspired me into my fullest capabilities was critical for shaping my growth. Please allow the opportunity for: 1. specifically, eighth graders to have the opportunity to take algebra if they are ready and desire it 2. more generally, to support both students who need extra support AND enable students seeking academic challenge to do so " -1	"We should look at states such as Massachusetts, Utah and Idaho that have the highest NAEP scores in Math for guidance rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Equity and Inclusion is important, but it should be approached from a lense of social studies and civics rather than hard sciences. A mathematics framework should be centered on physical laws rather than social constructs. There is room for both in the California school curriculum. " 1	"The attached letter letter is signed by six of California's education and advocacy organizations who have been collaborating over the past two years to ensure that educators have access to high-quality instructional materials that can meet the needs of our highest-need students and close persistent opportunity gaps. In this letter we request that the State Board of Education add language in Chapter 13 that ensures educators have access to math instructional materials that are aligned to the English Language Development (ELD) standards as well as the mathematics content standards.  Dear Members of the State Board of Education, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools (Mathematics Framework). This letter is signed by several of California's educational advocacy and research organizations, who have been working together for over two years to ensure that the Framework includes principles of equity and strategies to meet the needs of California's diverse student population. We believe that the updated Framework is asset-based and, if implemented properly, can help to close opportunity gaps in math instruction. We are also pleased to see the focus on equity in pedagogical approaches to teaching math still included from the previous version. Therefore, we write in support of approving the 2023 Mathematics Framework, with a modification to Chapter 13 that would ensure that instructional materials are aligned to English language development (ELD) standards. We thank the writers, staff, and members of the Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education for incorporating many of the comments members of this coalition have provided over the past two years. The updated Framework offers a strong vision for math instruction that is focused on deeper learning and on ensuring there is clear support and equitable access to rigorous coursework for all students. In particular, we appreciate the following areas the Framework emphasizes: _ Culturally Relevant and Asset-Based. The Framework offers strategies and vignettes that can make math culturally relevant to students of color and multilingual students. These include strategies for drawing on students' experiences, elevating the assets of linguistically diverse students and families, and incorporating families in math learning. The vignettes also highlight the diversity of students and offer examples of how educators can meet the needs of students with diverse learning needs. _ Supporting English Learners. The Framework offers guidance on supporting English learners and leveraging the language assets of students. We support references to the English Language Arts/ELD Framework, ELD standards, strategies and scaffolds to support English learners (ELs), and assessment considerations. However, there is still an area of opportunity to add language to Chapter 13, Category 1: Mathematics Content/Alignment with the Standards (lines 251-275), that would make alignment to ELD standards a key feature for instructional materials (please see letter submitted on June 6 that discusses this recommendation in more detail). Understanding that a Framework serves as guidance to the field, we also emphasize the following areas of focus moving forward that would ensure the promise within the Framework is achieved. _ Opportunity to Provide High Quality Instructional Materials. LEAs still need additional guidance and support for ensuring they adopt high quality instructional materials. Therefore, we hope that guidance from the Framework can be elaborated on and additional support provided to support LEAs in their adoption process. It is our hope that within the state adoption process the selected reviewers come with various areas of expertise in meeting the needs of our highest-need students, including English learners, students with disabilities, and students of color. Similar guidance about the areas of expertise that LEAs should include in their review processes should also be provided to the field. Tools and resources that can help meet the needs of high-need students should also be incorporated within the state and LEA adoption processes. For example, there are rubrics and tools available that should be incorporated, such as Criteria for Review of Instructional Materials' Success in Addressing MLL Linguistic and Instructional Needs, which was recently published by the California Curriculum Collaborative. _ Support for Implementation. While the Framework remains long, it does include many evidence-based instructional practices that can benefit LEAs, schools, and educators. Therefore, we hope that the state provides additional resources and supports to ensure the rich guidance in the Framework reaches the field and multiple audiences, including LEA leaders, educators, and families. These supports can include professional learning opportunities, tools, and resources. County offices of education must also play an important role in providing regional support and guidance to ensure equitable implementation. Key areas to consider are: 1) professional learning related to high-leverage instructional strategies, 2) support for districts in reviewing and updating policies around enrollment in rigorous math coursework, and 3) systems that provide equitable access for all students. Without support from the state and county offices, the promise included within the text of the Framework cannot be achieved. Thank you again for the opportunity to provide feedback on the draft 2023 Mathematics Framework. As always, we are happy to provide additional details or answer any questions. Sincerely," -1	"I am a parent of 3 children in the San Francisco Unified School District. We have experienced directly how harmful the district's math policies are. Our children need rigorous math education - this is the only path to equity and to equip all students to succeed in the future. The current draft of the framework dumbs down math education. As one example, this statement is laughable: 'Attaining fluency with multiplication and division within 100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students' work.' This is a pitifully low expectation. Many, many students are EAGER for challenges in math and we are moving backwards. We need algebra in middle school, strong geometry, trig, pre-calc and calculus in high school. Statistics is wonderful but is not a substitution for calculus, which students need in order to be competitive in colleges. I urge you to reject this framework that rests in part on flawed data from the SFUSD - data that has been demonstrated to be inaccurate. Please revise the framework to set challenging goals and support students in reaching those goals. " -1	"My wife and I deeply appreciate the time and effort you and staff put into the education of our future generations. But proposed math teaching methodologies are diametrically opposed to the real world where what you want is the right answer - quickly. Making answers in sentences is simply making long responses (Kindergarten-Grade two: Example problem #3) and is not real world where 36 plus 25 has 25 on top of 36 and you add: 5+6=11, write 1 and carry one over to the 3+2 column and 3+2 =5 + the 1 carried over = 61! That's real world - the one these kids will find in their employers 'Standard Operating Practices' manual. Not some circles equaling 10s. So parents who want their kids to learn math will adopt the methods of China and States who exceed in testing - call it repetitive learning! Not what you will propose for our classrooms! But the ray of sunshine will be the teacher who learned math in a 4 room farm community schoolhouse - repetitively - and will repeat that method in addition to what you now want. Thank you for this time and good luck! " 0	"Dear California State Board of Education: I wanted to draw your attention to a technical error in the third edition of the Mathematics Framework that should be changed before vote and publication. Chapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement includes a section on Personalized Learning beginning on page 13. Within this section, which we are strongly supportive of, there is an example of our innovative learning model which begins on page 15 starting with line 376 and continuing to line 378. It reads: "376 A study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019)." However, this study (Margolis, 2019) of our Teach to One model has been incorrectly attributed in to another example of a teacher-developed approach from Modern Classroom which starts on line 372: "372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended, self-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing in-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and competence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019)." It should instead read (as it did in draft two) : "372 In one successful teacher-developed approach, students engage in blended, self-paced, mastery-based learning with teacher-made videos supplementing in-class problem-solving individually and in collaborative groups, with continual assessment and revision of work moving students toward confidence and competence (Modern Classroom, 2021). A similar model developed by a middle school teacher and now taught in many schools, uses diagnostic assessments to create a tailored set of assignments for each student that the teacher can use in technology-infused mix of direct instruction, collaborative work with peers, and individualized learning. A study of this model found that participating students improved at a faster rate, on average, on mathematics assessments than did a nationally representative comparison group (Margolis, 2019)." I appreciate this opportunity to comment on the third draft of the Mathematics Framework and bring this technical error to your attention. " -1	"This is insane. Math is not a subjective subject. Math by definition only has one correct answer that has nothing to do with equity or environmental justice, or any of this other gobbledygook leftist nonsense you are pushing on the kids. California public education has gone from the top 10 to the bottom 10 in the Us since the left agenda has been implemented. How does that serve our kids? How are they supposed to compete in the world? You need to scrap this nonsense and get back to the basics.

We agree with the authors' compelling argument that we cannot afford any inaction or keep the status quo of mathematics teaching and learning. The mission of San Bernardino County Superintendent of Schools is to transform lives through education. This is in alignment with the goal of the framework to "ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the world." We are appreciative of the time and effort that was taken by the writers to take the call to action along with the current requirements of the Board of Education to create a document that views equity so important in this day and age. We appreciate the time and resources in producing a document that is consistent in language, organization and formatting. We look forward to using this document as a support for Educators, a place to calibrate and deepen our understanding of the teaching and learning of mathematics for the students of California.

The very students who will be harmed by this measure (and there are large numbers of them) are those minority students who have the ability to do algebra in the 8th grade but are told it is too difficult for them. What kind of a message is that? It is promoting a race to the bottom instead of helping students to excel. This has not worked in San Francisco - the results are dismal - so now you want to enact it state wide? Is that the role of government - to promote a failing policy that harms our students (as if COVID wasn't bad enough) in the name of diversity? That is shameful.

Having been a principal for the past seven years, I can say without hesitation that all of the resources, vignettes, and recommended instructional practices have been hugely helpful in supporting new and veteran teachers to provide engaging and meaningful math instruction for their students. I especially appreciate Chapter 2 which highlights 5 components of equitable and engaging teaching. I incorporated much of what was in this chapter into a professional learning series aimed at energizing and motivating teachers to plan their instruction around these practices. The throughline of focusing on equity in this framework is just what we need in our schools right now. PLEASE approve this framework! Sincerely, Sara Green " -1	"Absolutely rubbish. Absolutely a step in the wrong direction. You are about to assure that the rest of the world flies further ahead of this state while relegating math to a series of lessons to identify the ways the rest of the world flies ahead of this state.

Math is supposed to be objective, factual. Already I'm seeing bizarre ways of doing math being brought home by my first grader. But this new framework is a nightmare.

We all know what is intended by the word 'equity' and this is a gross misuse of power by our elected officials in an attempt to force indoctrination of our children.

CA should be using 2023 reality and awareness and NOT guidelines emerging from 2019. Everything has changed since 2019. CA needs to go back to the drawing board ASAP. "The guidelines are based on statutory requirements, feedback from focus group meetings in August of 2019, student focus groups in September and October 2019, information provided by the Instructional Quality Commission and the State Board of Education, and public comment." 2. Although this is a laudable goal it has NOTHING to do with teaching math. "The CFCC shall include ample concepts and strategies throughout the grade-level chapters to support universal access and ensure access, equity, and inclusion for all students." 3. NAEP math scores have plunged in CA. CA fails to include discussion of bringing up those students who do not have proficiency in basic math as the NAEP proves. 4. The insertion of equity discussion does not belong in Math class but rather in social sciences. 5. There is NO provision to bring up math proficiency but rather to create math class as a discussion class on equity. 6. UDL contractual agreement to teach math is not going to raise math scores or math competency. 7. NAEP scores lowest in a decade. Where is the math proficiency component in the math framework. 8. More significantly, perhaps, the amount of 13-year-olds deemed proficient or better in math went from 34 percent in 2019 to just 26 percent today. 9. In math scores went from terrible to worse: 41 percent proficient in 2019, to just 36 percent proficient in 2022 10. The NAEP reading proficiency was also stunningly low: 37 percent in 2019, down from 40 percent in 1998. 11.

I am also a California resident and a parent that cares deeply about education. I am a Computer Scientist, I teach college courses in data science and computer science and I have a solid understanding of the foundations needed for success in college-level STEM. I am also an experienced researcher and understand how to use data, evidence, and citations. I am very concerned with this draft. The revised version corrected some of the issues in v2. In particular, the MIC pathway (that was ill defined and should have never been there) was removed. But many glaring issues remain and few new ones were added. Most importantly, the document is very far from being useful and seems ideology-driven rather than evidence and research-based. It does not follow basic standards of scholarship. The stakeholders (students, parents, school districts, colleges, industry) expect and deserve a guidance document that is done professionally, that includes a careful synthesis of the education literature, and a review of best practices that work. The draft is a mockery of scholarship. Statements are being written with citations that frequently do not support the statements. Other citations are not to scholarly documents but to opinion pieces that make non-verifiable and sometimes egregious claims. At other occasions there is solid research that supports the opposite recommendation that is just being completely ignored. This is unacceptable. Another issue is the conflict-ridden UC area-C loophole, where courses that have very little math content were approved as "advanced math courses" that validate Algebra 2. The CMF earlier drafts were part of a mass campaign that deceived CA students and families with regard to the preparation needed for college-level STEM. The current v3 draft retracted some of this hype (removed the falsely-represented MIC pathway), but some of the hype remains. It is rather astonishing and unacceptable that the v3 draft still alludes to the faulty approval of these courses (a careless mistake at best) as a way to promote false ideas. The v3 draft made cosmetic and wording changes and still ignored many of the issues that were previously pointed out painstakingly by Brian Conrad and others. At this point it seems clear that the issues can not be simply fixed by addressing specific comments. Careful review and addressing in a sincere way all comments by Professor Brian Conrad, Mike Lawler and Tom Loveless will only get us part of the way. To create a helpful document, a new writing team needs to write the document from scratch. Finally, the time given to the public to review the 1000 pages draft, with so little warning, is insufficient. Especially for a document that is so far from being acceptable. I hope you will take responsibility for our students and all stakeholders and reject the current draft. " -1	"Math is not and cannot be based in equity principles.

However, the interaction of the big ideas and the other components (DI's, CC's, MP's) is unclear. Moreover, the big ideas seem to replace the CA-CCSS-M (at least on the student facing side) which may be an okay idea if on the teacher side the connections are clear. Unfortunately, the 900 pages of the framework fail to make those connections in the crucial and controversial area of Algebra 2 and Integrate 3. This sows distrust and concern.

" -1	"Concerned parent from San Francisco who has already seen the impacts of poor math policies. California students are already significantly behind in math test scores as compared to many counterparts around the world. Policies like this will make it worst.  " -1	"Dear California State Board of Education, I am writing to ask you to REJECT the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft (CMF) proposed for the Jul 12-13, 2023 meeting. To have a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce in the United States, we need students with advanced capabilities in mathematics to take higher level courses (such as Calculus) in High School so they can be competitive for acceptance and success into college STEM programs and careers. The CMF provides, at best, unclear pathways about how to allow students to get to higher level math classes in the K-12 public school system, and at worst, denies options for students to accelerate and get to Calculus by 12th grade. If adopted and implemented, the CMF will lead to greater inequities as students with financial means will seek math acceleration or all of their education outside of the public school system, leaving their mathematically advanced, but socio-economically disadvantaged peers, stuck in classrooms with students who are often 3-5 years below grade level with limited options to better their situation through STEM. The First Field Review of the proposed California Math Framework was explicit in their statement that all students will have a common math experience until grade 11. There was NO mention of courses like Algebra being an option in grade 8, and in fact, studies with false or misleading claims were used to support many of these arguments. Thankfully, the SBE did not pass that version nor the second version of the CMF, and this current, third, version now has some wiggle room in at least acknowledging that 8th grade Algebra could be an option. While progress has been made, I ask you to again reject this CMF and require that CLEAR Pathways be recommended with research to support these recommendations, as the current CMF is still very much focused on students not being able to accelerate until grade 11 as well as keeping with the original damaging consequences of lowering overall math course taking for high school students. The CMF clearly wants ALL students in the same math course with their grade level peers until grade 11 The CMF describes "heterogeneously grouped classrooms" from "grade school through high school" (Ch 1, line 208). The CMF notes "possible pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience, and a broader array of options in eleventh and twelfth grade." (Ch 8 line 702 and Ch 8 line 1295). Note that Chapter 10 Line 809 reads, "The framework recommends that all students take the same rich mathematics courses in kindergarten through grade eight." It is obvious that there are NOT CLEAR recommendations within the CMF about acceleration and course taking as two places say common courses through grade 10 and one through grade 8. Apparently some folks working on the CMF (such as was evidenced in the First Field Review) still want no acceleration before grade 11, but someone else has decided to back that up to no acceleration before grade 9. This confusing, unclear, and unsubstantiated advice should not be present in a CMF that the SBE adopts As "evidence" for why the US should not allow acceleration before grade 11, the CMF states, "Another review of international evidence about tracking found that, while most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries do not differentiate curriculum options for students until ninth or tenth grade, those that track students into different course options earlier increase inequality in learning significantly (Woessmann, 2009)." (Ch 9, Line 148) First, it is interesting to note that other countries (who are far outperforming the US in math) allow acceleration in grade 9 or 10, and yet the CMF is recommending waiting until grade 11. What is even more heinous in this quote is that the reference cited to justify holding students back from acceleration (Woessmann, 2009) discusses students being tracked into DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, not being allowed to accelerate into 1 different class within the same school. There are very different repercussions to students being moved to a different school while their peers are left at a "lower" school than there are with the current policy in California where a student might be in an advanced math class and then regular classes and another might be in regular math but then advanced English or History. This is akin to one student taking culinary arts while another takes photography and another ceramics. Students recognize, often as early as Kindergarten, that math is easier for some students and other aspects of school is easier for others. Do NOT approve a California Math Framework which makes recommendations about the harmful effects of acceleration based upon countries who do not have anywhere close to the same definition of what it means to "accelerate". What does non-acceleration look like? Since all students are recommended to be in the same math class until grade 11, the CMF describes what grade 10 classes should look like. We read, "When differentiation occurs at tenth grade to add greater challenge to the courses of advanced students, the curriculum remains similar, and both lanes allow students to reach advanced courses like calculus." (Ch 8 line 467) So advanced students, 1-3 years AHEAD of grade level standards are learning similar curriculum to students who are on grade level and also with students who are 3-7 years below grade level (which is the reality based upon the fact that more than 77% of 11th graders were below proficient on the SBAC in 2021-22) (link) with over 70% of students below proficient in grade 8. Who is the teacher really going to teach? If the teacher chooses the middle (which is common) the advanced students suffer and lose opportunities to get into STEM fields, and the lowest students also suffer falling even further behind. There is one vignette in the CMF that explains how to support this type of classroom successfully (Ch 9 beginning Line 327), but that relies upon two teachers and personalized learning where each student progresses at their own pace with occasional whole class investigations, and students able to complete "courses" anytime during the year and progress to the next course; e.g a student might complete Algebra I and begin Geometry in one year while another student completed just part of Algebra I. If this is the math instruction the CMF is guiding for, then there needs to be significantly more time dedicated to explaining this, supporting it with evidence and an explanation of how team teaching will work with students taking courses, some over 2 years and others over 2 months and how this looks on transcripts and affects college admission, etc. In Chapter 7 of the CMF, we read that Middle School "is a time when students make choices about mathematics courseworkÑor have those choices made for themÑthat have long-term implications, including for their college and career achievements." (Ch 7 line 51) One must ask, then, if students are to have a common math experience until grade 11 (as the CMF guides), isn't the CMF making choices for students that have "long term implications", such as their not being competitive for college admission into STEM majors or careers in STEM fields (as their peers in other states or private schools did accelerate before grade 11)? This CMF needs to be rejected and the version that is adopted needs to give CLEAR pathways that allow for acceleration BOTH in Middle School AND in High School so no one is held back and anyone can choose to accelerate when ready. Evidence used to defend no acceleration before grade 11 does not support this proposal. The CMF states, "These perceptions may also be linked to labelsÑ "low kids," "bubble kids," "slow kids" Ñthat lead to a differentiated and unjust mathematics education for students, with some channeled into low level math." (Ch 1 line 243). First, since when is "differentiated math" a bad thing? The CMF has stated how essential it is for a teacher to differentiate in their classroom (e.g.Ch [https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://e.g.Ch__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!doJIn0oSXS3nuOnlC4H_lVgbYdCtnvx2XONJsFTWS4nxv4RQiNHu4FzV1HcI1fLOdfbeHtMWOo9GKDr-QoKDh3Q_$] 8 line 467). Secondly, almost no school in California has a "low level" math class (unless it is for SPED students). In California, thanks to the California Math Content Standards, the 2013 CA Math Framework, and standardized testing (SBAC), students take their grade level math up through high school. There are hardly any high schools that offer a course LOWER than Algebra I or Integrated Math I, so the CMF is fighting a straw man. "Research indicates that in the era in which California policy encouraged all students to take Algebra in eighth grade, success for many students was undermined. Several studies found that, contrary to the hoped-for improvements, widespread acceleration often led to declines in overall mathematics achievement. One study found that most students who took Algebra in the eighth grade failed to score "proficient" on the end-of-course Algebra California Standards Test (CST). Students who failed eighth-grade Algebra and thus took the Algebra CST again at the end of their ninth-grade year scored lower on average than students who took the Algebra CST for the first time at the end of ninth grade (Liang, Heckman, and Abedi, 2012)." (Ch 8 Line 269) This is an accurate statement and it is very true that not ALL students should be required to accelerate in grade 8. The experiment many low performing districts engaged in by placing all 8th graders in Algebra I to not take a "hit" on their API score was horrible for all students. That said, that is hardly evidence for saying no one should accelerate. Where is the logical reasoning the CMF constantly argues for? Are the only options no one accelerates in grade 8 or everyone does? What about those who are ready to accelerate, get to? During this same time period described above, many high performing (high SES) districts were very restrictive about who got to take Algebra I in grade 8, and those schools typically had all students achieve advanced on the test that year and in subsequent years. In addition, the very next section of the CMF describes a program where all students in New York accelerated and that was successful. So, how can the SBE adopt a framework that draws such inaccurate conclusions as this CMF does and propose large scale changes based upon these false claims? Chapter 9 line 120 reads, "For many, this tracking begins in the early years of elementary schoolÑoften around third grade." There is no citation here and NO evidence of this being the practice in California. Many districts allow acceleration in high school, while most allow it in grades 7 or 8 with a very few allowing acceleration in grade 6. It is just not the case that "for many" acceleration (meaning taking a course above your current grade level) occurs in grade 3 (or even 4 or 5). The "solutions" to allow students to accelerate and reach Calculus are unjust and will harm socio-economically disadvantaged students The CMF proposes students eliminate or skip a course (apparently either Algebra II or Pre-Calculus) in high school to be able to reach calculus. "An alternative to eighth grade acceleration would be to adjust the high school curriculum instead, eliminating redundancies in the content of current courses, so that students do not need four courses before Calculus. As enacted, Algebra II tends to repeat a significant amount of the content of Algebra I, and Precalculus repeats content from Algebra II." (Ch 8 line 688, also stated again in Chapter 8, line 1295) What does this look like? If the CMF is proposing this, they should map out possible course sequences to show which standards would be addressed in each course, ensuring students have time to develop conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and applications in real world contexts. While the CMF claims that it is very possible to complete 5 courses (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra 2, Precalculus and Calculus) over the 4 years of high school, it also argues that students who don't accelerate in middle school are "stuck". Chapter 9 line 121 reads, "Schools sometimes use elementary school test data to determine students' placement, which typically also determines their ultimate destination. Because students are then taught different content, they often cannot easily change pathways. This practice is unjustifiable." I agree wholeheartedly that it is unjustifiable to determine if a student can have a STEM career based upon what they do in elementary school; however, this is another logical fallacy. Why can't some students accelerate in middle school (if they show they are ready) and others accelerate in high school (as proposed above)? A CMF the SBE approves should have MULTIPLE entry and exit points for students to choose to accelerate or go back to a regular paced pathway throughout middle and high school. Many districts have such pathways and options (for example Irvine Unified in Orange County and Palm Springs Unified in San Bernardino County). If we truly want to support all students to have the opportunity to achieve STEM careers, we need flexible pathways starting in middle school! The CMF proposes summer classes to allow students to accelerate. "Schools may also organize supplemental course taking in summer programs, to allow students who start Algebra or Mathematics I in ninth grade to be able to take Calculus in high school if they choose." (Ch 8 line 696) Why should a student have to go to summer school to accelerate? This is particularly unjust for Socio-economically disadvantaged students who often have to work or provide childcare for siblings during the summer. The CMF proposes "doubling up" to allow students to accelerate. In Chapter 8 line 819 we read, "So, in her fourth year, she enrolls in her school's precalculus class, along with a half-semester support class her school offers for students whose interest in mathematics grows late in their high school time." Why does a student need to forgo an elective or other course which might help them get ahead for college or career to take another math class because the CMF decided it wanted all students in the same class until grade 11? The CMF proposes students can take extra courses. "One form of flexible grouping involves moving the beginning of separate course pathways to later gradesÑe.g., from fourth, fifth, or sixth grade to at least eighth gradeÑand supporting extra course-taking options during the school year or during summer school so that students may accelerate at any time during middle or high school." (Ch 8 line 226) The public school system needs to allow for acceleration without the extra burden on students to take extra classes or summer classes. Requiring this extra time will increase inequity as students with financial means will go outside the public school system to get their needs met and their less fortunate peers will be stuck doubling up, in summer school or without the opportunity to accelerate and reach Calculus. The recommendations of the CMF around high school course taking lowers expectations, and as such, will harm CA students The CMF proposes DROPPING the current practice of having all students take Algebra II, and, instead, offer easier, more interesting courses. This is lowering expectations rather than providing extra support to allow all students to succeed in Algebra II, thus keeping their options open for college degrees and careers. Chapter 8 line 730 reads, "In addition to offering Mathematics III or Algebra II, districts have the flexibility to offer other third-year and fourth-year courses." The SBAC only assesses high school students in grade 11, and a large portion of the content comes from Algebra II. If students do not take Algebra II, they will fail the exam in even high percentages. Rather than providing supports to help struggling students master Algebra II standards, the CMF proposes just not completing that challenging course. The CMF does note that "If students take another third-year course (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors)." (Ch 8 line 758) The CMF points out that "to meet the law" students really only need Algebra I. Chapter 8 line 677 states, "By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II,[1] students will satisfy the requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I." The SBE and California should not be okay with the CMF's attitude of "lowering the bar". Nearly every district expects students to complete Algebra II; to enact the CMF's proposal would be to go backwards in progress towards equity to which California has made great strides. The SBE should adopt a CMF that clearly suggests pathways to accelerate beginning in middle school to ensure we support our mathematically inclined students. In a line meant to support NOT accelerating before grade 11, the CMF actually points out a major reason TO accelerate as early as middle school: advanced math students tend to get bored and disinterested in math when they are grouped in a class with students with a massive range of proficiency. In Chapter 8 line 877 we read, "The UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools (BOARS) made a similar statement: BOARS commends the Common Core's goal of deeper understanding of the mathematical concepts taught at each KÐ12 grade level. A strong grasp of these ideas is crucial for college coursework in many fields, and students should be sure to take enough time to master the material. Choosing an individually appropriate course of study is far more important than rushing into advanced classes without first solidifying conceptual knowledge. Indeed, students whose math classes are at a mismatched levelÑeither too advanced or too basicÑoften become frustrated and lose interest in the topic. (BOARS, 2016)" Clearly the SBE has been grappling with the issue of acceleration as evidenced from the changing perspective from the first Field Review CMF (no acceleration before grade 11) to an attitude of It's possible, but not desired, to accelerate in Middle School. I ask the SBE to reject this version of the CMF until clear pathway options with supporting evidence can be explained (or take out any mention of acceleration as the CMF is clearly not in a position to "guide" with their unclear descriptions and writing.) In fact, the CMF (in this third version) notes that more discussion is needed: "It would be helpful for the state to convene a working group of mathematics experts to discuss and clarify possible high school pathways." (Ch 8 line 245) Students in California should have every opportunity to attain to high levels of math (including Calculus) if they want. These opportunities to "accelerate" should be clearly mapped out in a CMF the SBE adopts and have multiple entry points and opportunities for students to get on or off the accelerated pathways throughout middle and high school (when gaps become larger issues and students need challenge and have interest in high levels of math). These pathways should be built upon options students can take in the regular school day without having to "double up" and lose electives. The current CMF is a mess in terms of advice they give districts; the CMF clearly does not want anyone to accelerate before grade 11, but then the CMF states not before grade 9 and then confounds accelerating in math for a single class within a heterogeneous high school with "tracking" in other countries in which students join entirely different, homogeneous schools. California students who want STEM degrees and/or careers need to be competitive with students from other states, countries and private schools. This CMF is holding them back and needs to be rejected.

Chapter 9: Structuring School Experiences for Equity and Engagement - 'slow' vs. 'speed' was discussed. The discussion did not address the situations when 'slow' is necessary and 'fast' are required. It is similar to riding a bicycle, we start out slow, and through practice, we are able to ride 'fast' without even thinking about the riding process. Students can learn to be 'fast' in basic math. When facing a complex problem, 'slow' is definitely the best approach. The discussion in Chapter 9 does not address the need for students to become 'fast' for basic math such as multiplication. I volunteered as a tutor in a continuation program. The students needed calculators to figure out what is 8X7. I gave them a multiplication table to practice on. They have to learn to ride without training wheels (calculators). Another example of 'fast' vs 'slow', if I am asked what is d x2 /dy, I should be able to give the answer instantly and not have to take the 'slow' approach. General questions - The US is behind on math compared to the rest of the world. And CA is below US average. That is a rather sad state of affairs.

If anyone else found that part, please tell me. The framework defines equity as: "Equity. Equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness. Drawing from Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power." Do we really need to be focused on student identity development in math, or attention to relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is objectively insane to me. From the overview: "The goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldÑin their careers, in college, and in civic life." From chapter 1: "Reflecting the state's commitment to equity, every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all." Equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2, 9 and 10. It's also focused on "environmental literacy" Ð which has nothing to do with learning math. In summary, the horse is out of the barn on this math framework and I don't think anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. It is not surprising that they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas. My recommendation would be to completely scrap this entire framework and model a new framework based on those that have proven successful Ð like those in Massachusetts, Utah, Idaho and China for starters.

If anyone else found that part, please tell me. The framework defines equity as: "Equity. Equity refers to fairness in education rather than sameness. Drawing from Gutierrez (2012), equity includes four dimensions in mathematics education: (1) Access to tangible resources; (2) Participation in quality mathematics classes and success in them; (3) Student identity development in mathematics; and (4) Attention to relations of power." Do we really need to be focused on student identity development in math, or attention to relations of power? Can we not just teach everyone MATH? This is objectively insane to me. From the overview: "The goal is to ensure equity and excellence in math learning so that all California students become powerful users of mathematics to better understand and positively impact the worldÑin their careers, in college, and in civic life." From chapter 1: "Reflecting the state's commitment to equity, every chapter in this framework highlights considerations and approaches designed to help mathematics educators create and maintain equitable opportunities for all." Equity is such a heavy focus that the term is used in the titles of chapters 2, 9 and 10. It's also focused on "environmental literacy" Ð which has nothing to do with learning math. In summary, the horse is out of the barn on this math framework and I don't think anything can be done to change course. We have extreme partisans in the office of superintendent and at the highest levels of CDE. It is not surprising that they are using their positions to indoctrinate children with leftist ideas.

If California is to keep its place as an economic world leader, it must keep up with countries and US states that let math education pump graduates INTO the workforce, not filter them OUT. Our previous system only has the benefit of keeping established math professors in their comfort zones, unchallenged in their superiority. We can do better and the proposed framework is a tool to do just that!

That is, the major point of a problem is to raise questions that can be answered and encourage students to use their intuition to address the questions before learning new mathematical ideas." I strongly oppose the recommendation of what is otherwise known as "productive struggle". First, in the website for the Common Core Math Standards, it states that the standards do not require specific pedagogies, but CMF is certainly doing that.

" -1	"I strongly oppose the proposed math framework and find it utterly unacceptable that the general public is being granted a mere 11-day window to review and provide feedback on the revised draft. This period even includes a federal holiday on a Tuesday, which further restricts the available time for scrutiny. To make matters worse, there was no prior notification or updates regarding the Schedule of Significant Events, with no modifications made to that page since July of 2022. Suddenly, a colossal 1006-page document materializes on the website in late June. This disregard for transparency and public input is especially outrageous considering the multitude of issues identified in the previous draft. During the second field review, numerous problems were exposed within the initial draft. These issues range from misrepresented citations and misconceptions about the requisite math skills for contemporary college degrees in both STEM and STEM-adjacent fields to an inadequately developed Data Science pathway, which clearly has no rightful place in this framework. Additionally, the draft presented flawed opinion-based recommendations concerning high-school pathways, acceleration, equity, technology, assessment, and placement. Such a flawed approach is detrimental to the well-being and education of our children. " -1	"Algebra should be taught in 8th grade for those who are ready for it. Failure to offer it will only harm children and put them further behind in their education. Stop dumbing down the curriculum.  " -1	"Are we there yet? A new framework was adopted in 2013 which replaced California's 'Algebra for all in 8th grade' policy. A lot of misinformation was disseminated to say that California students were not doing well in Algebra 1 by using 'repeat rates' instead of failure. A circus shell game if ever there was one. Students had to pass the Algebra 1 CST (old STAR system) and receive a C in order to be promoted to Geometry. The Ed Code changed in 2016 *and* the math placement act also was enacted to stop forcing students to repeat classes based on test scores if they had already passed the class. It is nonsense to use data pre 2013 as a comparison to post common core. However? We do have an on going experiment in San Francisco based on Dr. Boaler's recommendations, many which are in this framework. And in fact this framework reads like an informercial for Youcubed, her Stanford 'non profit'. San Francisco did not track previously, everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 8th grade. In 2014 everyone was placed in algebra 1 in 9th grade. There was no improvement in grades. What did happen is the underserved communities lost access to higher math Precalculus enrollment did not increase. SFUSD lied about their compression class, calling it Algebra 2 + Precalculus but UC a-g rejects it as a precalculus class and gives Algebra 2 credit. This under preparation harms students. Diversifying STEM is extremely important. This framework does not accomplish this goal. It will increase opportunity gaps as the resourced supplement. The 'Sold a Story' podcast (literacy) should be required listening because we're about to do the same thing in math. SFUSD stands as a warning beacon to all that pass. Do not do this. It has failed. Let's not wait 10 years and say 'ooops'. This is not a holodeck simulation. Real people's lives are at stake. We cannot afford to leave BIPOC students behind as SFUSD has done. Please reject this and rewrite it with true equity in mind. Not superficial hallmark card sentiments.  " 1	"Please adopt this framework. I am a K-12 Math educator, parent of public school grads, university math educator and I support this framework.  " 1	"I sent in many criticisms of the last version of the Framework. As far as I can tell in this short time available, most of my comments were addressed other than the length of the document.

On behalf of CPM, I urge the Board to approve the revised 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools: Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve. " 1	"This framework is so important for our students. We need change around mathematics, and giving students the opportunity to learn learn through big ideas, have more choice with different pathways and provide opportunities for ALL students is essential. Please vote for the changes in the framework for our kids! " -1	"The prior drafts of the CMF had serious problems with accurate and appropriate references. Claims that have been removed from prior drafts include: (i) The repeat rate in San Francisco schools when algebra was moved from 8th to 9th grade fell from 40% to 8%, and (ii) Most of the neuroscience claims related to learning math Problems with references continue with this draft. My recommendation is that all references that are not published and peer reviewed academic work be either removed or replaced with proper references. If they cannot be replaced, the items in the CMF that depend on the non-academic references need to be removed, too. I'll provide two examples of non-academic references below that should be removed, but these are just two examples to make the point clear. All of the non-academic references need to be examined carefully by the California Department of Education. For example, the Boaler, Munson, and Williams reference from Youcubed - What is Mathematical Beauty - is not academic research and ends with an advertisement for books written by the authors. As Boaler is also an author of the CMF, having a reference advertising her books included in the CMF is inappropriate. A second example is the Boaler and Foster paper on Youcubed - Raising Expectations and Achievement. Again, this is not academic research. The paper has a paragraph on page 2 characterizing opposition to the CMF as political. It is inappropriate to have a reference in the CMF criticizing opposition to the CMF. This paper also discusses a study - referred to as 'study 2' in the paper - that compares results of 5 tests in 2014 to the result of 1 test in 2015. This comparison is meaningless as you cannot conclude anything about student achievement from a score difference on an Algebra II test one year and an 8th grade math test in the next year. This reference to the study in this paper in Chapter 9 of the CMF goes even farther to state (without reference or explanation) that the difference amounts to about 2 years of schooling. The claims about 'study 2' in chapter 9 of the CMF are an example of important claims in the CMF (in this case, tracking) that are not backed by published academic research. Again, this reference - and all non-academic research cited in the CMF - needs to either be removed or replaced by references to academic research. As this particular claim relates to exams from 2014 and 2015, there has been plenty of time to publish research on these exam scores. If the only discussion of these exam scores is the post on Youcubed, this reference and the discussion about tracking supported by it, needs to be removed. There are millions of students in California whose lives will be affected by the CMF It is the responsibility of the California Department of Education to ensure that the ideas in the document are supported properly. Non academic work like blog posts, books, or newspaper articles do not have the same standard as academic work. The inclusion of advertisements and political statements about opposition are obviously not appropriate references. Non-academic studies cannot be central to the CMF's proposal either. Once the references are corrected (or the material removed), what remains in the CMF can be evaluated properly. " -1	"I am a parent of SF public school children. The framework you plan to adopt prevents algebra in eight grade, which has proven ineffective in SF. Please do not adopt it statewide.

" -1	"As a parent of three kids in the public school system in California, I'm writing to express my concern with Version 3 of the California Math Framework. Specifically, I'm concerned with the promotion of a for-profit curriculum (YouCubed) that lacks robust research evidence and runs counter to the wisdom of many STEM teachers and researchers. I fear that this move will put California students further behind in math. People with privilege (myself included) may be able to compensate by teaching our kids ourselves or enrolling them in supplemental programs, whereas families without those resources are vulnerable to widening disparities in math achievement and fluency as a result of this misguided effort. Additionally, I am concerned about the removal of Algebra as an option for 8th graders who are ready for it. Providing opportunities for STEM advancement in public schools is one the greatest gifts we can give our kids. Please do not shortchange California public school students.  " -1	"I find it unconscionable that the public would be given only 11 days to review and comment on the revised draft of this framework, a period containing a Tuesday federal holiday, no less. There was no advance notice or updates to the Schedule of Significant Events provided (no changes made to that page since July of 2022), and a 1006 page document simply appeared on the website in late June. This is particularly egregious in light of the multitude of problems found in the prior draft. The second field review exposed many issues in that draft, including those of misrepresented citations, misconceptions about the math skills required for contemporary college degrees, both in STEM and STEM-adjacent fields, a mathematically anemic Data Science pathway that had no business being part of this framework in the first place, and faulty opinion-based recommendations related to high-school pathways, acceleration, equity, technology, assessment, and placement. These issues are on record in the SFR public comments from Brian Conrad, Maya Keshavan, Edith Cohen, Jelani Nelson, and others. In my preliminary reading of this 2023 draft, I've found the same statements of opinion, many of them reworded to sound slightly less objectionably mistaken, and often with no evidence cited whatsoever. Misrepresented citations still appear, even though Brian Conrad had pointed them out in painstaking detail, and the CMF assertions for those that were removed still remain in the revised document. Chapter 8 illustrates 'pathways for high school coursework, reflecting a common ninth- and tenth-grade experience,' and this experience puts Algebra 1 squarely in 9th grade (not 8th), even though the Superintendent of San Francisco Unified School District has announced that this plan has failed after 10 years of shoddy proficiency performance, and families are clamoring to have the district bring back Algebra in 8th grade. The cited evidence being used to support nearly all of the bold assertions and change guidance in this framework are rarely from appropriate sources, and when they are, they represent a one-sided take from the existing body of evidence. I will follow up with another comment, covering this issue in more detail. You must reject this framework and go back to the drawing board. " -1	"A big lie and big failure, as proven with evidence in news media recently, for San Francisco Unified School District!!!

" -1	"A big lie and big failure in San Francisco Unified School District!!! Why would you want to spread this lie to other school districts in California!!! " -1	"I am a parent of two current high school students in San Francisco. I strongly feel that the elimination of an option for Algebra for San Francisco 8th graders has been a huge mistake and created missed opportunities for so many students with an aptitude for math and a desire to pursue careers in STEM. My daughters both love math and always excelled in their studies but were not given the opportunity in 8th grade to take Algebra. They both know they want to pursue a college degree in a STEM field and will need to complete Calculus in 12th grade in order to be competitive for the programs they are interested in. Finding a path for them to be able to reach Calculus in 12th grade has not been easy. My older daughter took Algebra online ahead of 9th grade through a paid online course and then had to pass an exam administered by the district in order to take Geometry as a 9th grader. My younger daughter plans to study and hopefully pass a course in PreCalculus in the summer between 11th and 12th grade in order to take Calculus in 12th grade. We need a California math framework that is data-driven, research-proven, and teacher-supported, and does not leave our students behind the rest of the nation.  " -1	"I have 3 children in public school and it would be doing them a major disservice to create a new Mathmatics Framework that would prevent 8th graders from access to Algebra 1.

" -1	"It is shameful that our educational leaders are not pushing to advance math skills and to push our children into achieving higher levels of mathematics. As a parent of a rising 6th grader and a rising 5th grader I am flabbergasted that the goal is not to try to get more children into Algebra in 8th grade. We should be aiming higher and raising the bar rather than putting California children at a competitive disadvantage. Please allow children that are ready to progress to keep growing and work on getting more children into 8th grade Algebra, not preventing them from achieving more. " -1	"It is extremely troubling that the SBE is rushing this egregiously flawed document through under cover of darkness, given it impacts millions of children. I would like to comment on just a few of the proposed CMF's errors: 1) Rampant citation misrepresentation: Many of the documents' assertions are quite simply hard to believe. They were justified via citations to other papers. In essentially all cases, the papers were seriously misrepresented in the CMF. Some even had conclusions opposite to what was said in the CMF. The solution is to remove all references to non-academic research, since those papers have NO standards and are not good references for a math framework that is going to affect millions of children. The next step is to replace all references that are not peer reviewed academic papers with references to actual research. Can't find any? Well you have your answer! 2) Gross conflict of interest: CMF author(s) stand to profit from recommendations made in the document (eg, selling recommended curriculum). This presents a significant conflict of interest. Probably, it is illegal. 3) Misrepresentation of data science field: The authors conflate statistics and data science; they are not the same. Also, data science undergraduate degrees require calculus, and data science jobs at Spotify, Salesforce, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, etc. require degrees in fields such as math, economics, engineering, computer science, etc., and these require calculus and linear algebra. Overall, the field and its prerequisites are grossly misrepresented. Worse, The CMF writing team has ignored the explicit warnings by SBE member Patricia Rucker that bias towards data science over other math routes is forbidden. 4) Activism and jargon vs substance: The document contains lengthy passages having little to do with math content and graphics giving no relevant information.  " -1	"As an educator, I am opposed to the Framework as it is currently put together.

Children of parents of means circumvent the lack of algebra by paying for online coursework, children who grasp the subject matter are bored in their classes, and ultimately disadvantaged kids are simply left further behind.

California should not follow this same failed pattern and lose millions of students. In San Francisco, instead of promoting equity, it deepened the divide. Instead of different pathways within the same schools, there is a huge divide with public school student lagging behind private school students in math. California needs workers who have the mathematics background to succeed in the tech industries and California students need college and career paths that will sustain them in this high cost of living state.

Failing to have this as an integral part of the math framework widens the socioeconomic gaps among our California students and citizens.  " -1	"The mathematics framework for K-12 students should state that math instructions and curriculum used in public school would have no influence or indoctrination from, or association with, political viewpoints and goals toward social justice, and racial equity. Correlation is not causation. Just as the Super Bowl Indicator is neither believable nor accurate, the correlation between students' racial makeup and math performance can not be used to argue that race is a factor in students' math or academic performance. If we gather enough data, we may find a strong positive correlation between math performance and religion, or math performance and hair color, or math performance and students' favorite sport or hobby. But it would be unwise for us to try to achieve equity in religion, hair color, sports or hobby. Rather, students' performance is the result of numerous factors, including family dynamic, family value and attitude about education, students' personal motivation, students' academic abilities, student's time living in the US, students' study habits and sturdy time, parents' involvement in students' daily learning, teaching effectiveness at schools, etc. Every kid is different, so we should not strive for equalized outcome. Some kids will be good in math, and some won't, just like some will be good in language arts and some won't. Let those who wish to study advanced materials do so, and let others who only wish to learn the basics do as they wish. Taxpayers of CA should find schools that teach useful and practical math in grades k-12 to prepare students for career or higher education, and give equal access and learning opportunity to all students at public schools; taxpayers should not fund educational framework or curriculum that is tied to social justice, racial equity, social activism, or political viewpoints/bias.

One more thing to lower standards and make our kids LAST. How does the state expect to recoup this loss by adding a more complex system of instruction? LooK at the test scores but more importantly listen to teachers and parents. Trust me when I tell you the struggles of our rising 5th grader not knowing his times tables! I directly attribute this to the curriculum trying to do too many things at once - multiple concepts and approaches and hardly any memorization to get it into long term memory. I'm pleading with you all to simplify this. It's already over engineered! And you're going to make it worse. Right now we go through nightly pain of teaching "math facts" and concepts instead of the actual practicing problems. This overtaxes the young child's brain to the point where when faced with choices, they don't know which approach to take. PLEASE don't do this!! You are confusing our students Loveless states: "Big ideas, open-ended tasks, collaborative problem solving, lessons on mindset, and inquiry-based teachingÑthese are foundational to the framework. The proposed California Math Framework not only ignores key expectations of the state's math standards, but it also distorts or redefines them to serve a reform agenda. The standards call for students to know "from memory" basic addition facts by the end of 2nd grade and multiplication facts by the end of 3rd grade. But the framework refers to developing fluency with basic facts as a major topic of 4th through 6th grades. Fluency is redefined to disregard speed. Instruction on standard algorithms is delayed by interpreting the grades for culminating standards as the grades in which standard algorithms are first encountered. California's students will be taught the standard algorithm for division years after the rest of the world." " -1	"Adopting the new Math framework would be terrible. We need to support gifted children not bring them down. " -1	"I'm not sure why anyone thinks that setting up CMF to model San Francisco is a good idea. I live in San Francisco. I've noticed quite a few Kumon businesses have sprung up. Why do you think that is??? Because parents who have children in San Francisco public schools know that in order for their children to succeed and be ready for High School math they need to pay for after school lessons. This alone makes 'EQUITY' a joke. You will never achieve equity, it's a ridiculous idea to try and achieve. Equal opportunity needs to be the focus and Item 11 will do just the opposite. Shame on anyone who thinks lowering standards is a good idea. It's racist in nature. Everyone voting on this item should do research on the results that recently came out regarding San Francisco's elimination of 8th grade algebra. It's dismal. If this passes, everyone who voted in favor will be on the wrong side of history.  " -1	"Eliminating the opportunity for 8th graders in California public schools to take Algebra will have devastating consequences for kids who like math. My child was a student in SFUSD K-8 schools and was so bored by the math curriculum that we ended up having to supplement from 2-8th grades. Slowing down the curriculum was meant to bring more students along the math path, and she put a ton of effort into helping her classmates, but studies show this experimental policy has failed the kids it was meant to help. The idea that slowing down the curriculum for all kids instead of meeting individual kids where their abilities lie will leave California's public school students at a disadvantage when competing for degrees and jobs that require math skill. For high school we decided to leave our district in favor of a private school as did many families who have the resources to opt out. As more families experience this slower math curriculum and opt out when they can, CA public schools will become a second class education option- one that will not prepare students to compete in a job market that increasingly favors degrees in math and science. Please do not adopt this horrible policy. Instead put resources into meeting all children where they're at.

SFUSD math policy was one of the major factors SFUSD school board were recalled in an unprecedent public election. This failed math experiment must not plague other California public schools. As saddened as I am to see my child and her peers to have served as guinea pigs in this ill advised endeavor, I implore you to reconsider this, if you wish to educate California children further to become ready not only for STEM careers, but also in other fields where analytical and math skills are required.  " -1	"As a school counselor for the past 18 years and now a parent of middle school students, I have seen what failing to provide eighth grade algebra has done to our students. In San Francisco, it has not increased the number of black and brown students who can access higher level math, it has done nothing to ensure that there's equity in the math provided for all of our students. Instead, it has created circuitous and stressful alternate pathways for our students who want to excel in mathematics at a higher level. They are forced to take algebra during their ninth grade year and compress their geometry, algebra 2, or their pre-Calc learning into shortened periods of time so that they can achieve their goal of taking AP calculus during senior year, or AP statistics. This means that there are mathematics courses that are not given the year long time for a student to truly learn that particular math, and it means the student has to undergo an incredibly stressful situation to compact a math course into a short amount of time. Please do not use San Francisco unified as an example of "where it works". Instead, use us as an example of what not to do, which is eradicate eighth grade algebra. It didn't work. And it just left families upset, and students with inadequate learning opportunities.

If the 8th graders who are high achievers have the option to attend summer school or after school programs for advancement, then that should ameliorate the issue. But you have to make it clear that the solid basis of Math is adequately taught. And why are there budget cuts when our state has a surplus?

" -1	"My comments are attached in file named K Fuson changes on third draft 7 5 23. Problems that need fixing in the third draft of the California Math Framework Karen C. Fuson, Emerita Professor Northwestern University Common Core State Standards feedback team, author team of NBT and OA Progressions Contributor to the 2013 California Math Framework This version has corrected many issues and is much easier to read.  Thanks for all of the hard work.  But there are still errors in this draft about what the CA CCSS say about standard algorithms and the centrality of multiplication and division in Grade 3. The Framework correctly emphasizes that students need to develop understanding of multidigit operations.  But it confuses fluent use of a standard algorithm with the first use of a standard algorithm.  It repeatedly states that standard algorithms can only be introduced/taught/learned in the grade at which the CA CCSS say that students must use a standard algorithm fluently.  The CA CCSS clearly state that students are to develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods in the first year in which that kind of computation is introduced: California CCSS p 14:  Grade 1 "students are to develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10." California CCSS p. 18: Grade 2 students "solve problems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction, and they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in base-ten notation, using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations." So in grade 1 and 2 in the California CCSS some versions of standard algorithms which are efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods can and even must be developed, but they should be done meaningfully and with drawings. California CCSS 1.NBT.4: Add within 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number, and adding a two-digit number and a multiple of 10, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relation- ship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used. California CCSS 2.NBT.7: Add and subtract within 1000, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method. The CMF nicely shows variations in multiplication standard algorithms as efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods.  The CMF needs to do the same for grade 1 and 2 accessible versions of standard algorithms that would enable California students to develop, understand, and explain general methods.  A description of these drawn from NCTM materials are below on pages 4 to 6.  This material could be added earlier in Chapter 6 or just before the table about fluent use of standard algorithms. Therefore these changes need to be made to be consistent with the CA CCSS: Chapter 6 lines 1563 to 1567 need to be omitted: Everyday Mathematics offers guidance for families, explaining how premature instruction in standard algorithms can often lead to erroneous and even harmful ideas. Students may come to believe that mathematics is mostly about memorizing, that mathematics problems should be solved in a few minutes, and that there is just one right way to solve a problem. KCF:  This is false.  I carried out the five-year evaluation of Everyday Mathematics for Max Bell as requested by NSF.  Teachers in Everyday Math allowed students to use their own methods but then taught the bad standard algorithms right before spring tests.  These opinions about standard algorithms arise from bad teaching and bad algorithms not from the fact that all standard algorithms are bad. 1568 to 1594 also is false as seen above and needs to be replaced by the blue paragraph below: Note that the CA CCSSM do not include standard algorithms in transitional kindergarten through grade three, although there are standards addressing fluencies needed for proficiency in standard algorithms in later grades. Instead, as shown in figure 6.31, the progression related to standard algorithms begins with the standard algorithm for addition and subtraction in grade four; the algorithm for multiplication is addressed in grade five; and the introduction of the standard algorithm for whole number division comes in grade six. (Chapter seven addresses grade six.) REPLACE WITH: The CA CCSSM do not call for fluency with standard algorithms in grades TKÐ3, so there is time to develop meanings for accessible standard algorithms with drawings in these grades.  The CA CCSSM do say that first-grade "Students develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10."  (California CCSS p 14).  And second-grade students "solve problems within 1000 by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction, and they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in base-ten notation, using their understanding of place value and the properties of operations." (California CCSS p 18).   The CA CCSSM place fluent use of standard algorithms at the grades indicated below in the table.  Fluent use means without drawings or other visual representations, so it is important to introduce sense-making with drawings and easy variations of standard algorithms at earlier grades. In Chapter 3 there is now a lovely example and discussion in lines 456 to 476 about first graders using efficient, flexible, generalizable methods.  But the final two sentences are wrong and need to be removed.  The important and lovely discussion is correct but these sentences are false and are not needed. "Note that while students in first grade do begin to add two-digit numbers, they do so using strategies as distinguished from formal algorithms. The CA CCSSM intentionally place the standard algorithms for addition and subtraction in fourth grade (4.NBT.4)."  Not true; the CA CCSSM place fluency with standard algorithms for addition and subtraction in fourth grade (4.NBT.4) A second major problem that needs to be corrected is that the CMF refers to just one standard algorithm as if there is just one.  This is wrong.  The NBT Progression clarifies that there is no single standard algorithm for any operation: "The Standards do not specify a particular standard algorithm for each operation. This progression gives examples of algorithms that could serve as the standard algorithm and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. p.3" and "In mathematics, an algorithm is defined by its steps and not by the way those steps are recorded in writing. This progression gives examples of different recording methods and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. p.3" Yet the California Math Framework repeatedly talks about "the standard algorithm" as one written method and does not recognize or emphasize for the early grades this crucial variation in written methods which can arise from the thinking of different students.  The CMF does recognize this for multiplication and gives good examples in Chapter 6.  But it is crucial to do so for Grades 1 and 2. These variations in how to write the standard algorithm vary in difficulty.  Some are easier than others and result in fewer errors.  It would be helpful if California teachers were aware of these better variations. The Framework rightfully stresses student understanding and explaining of methods and finding advantages and disadvantages of various methods.  This meaning-making with variations of standard algorithms is an important part of the learning progression for multidigit computation and can occur in any grade level before fluency is expected.  This point should be clear in the Framework.  An NCTM publication [Focus in Grade 2 (2011).  Reston, VA: The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Inc. pp. 87-89] has figures that show for addition and subtraction how Grade 2 students can use drawings for easier variations of standard algorithms, explain those drawings, and answer questions from classmates.  It would be helpful for these examples to appear in the Framework where teachers can see them.  These are not fluent uses of standard algorithms because they involve drawings.  These are building meanings for steps in accessible methods that will make fluency easier at Grade 4 when the drawings may be dropped. The California Math Framework rightfully emphasizes meaning-making approaches to computation.  It now can clarify that these meaning-making approaches form a learning path in which the easier variations of standard algorithms can be discussed and used by students meaningfully in the earlier grades if students use drawings or place-value objects to support their thinking.  Using these examples from NCTM is especially important because teachers need to see uses students can make of drawings and that students can explain steps in written methods. These examples can be inserted in Chapter 3 or in Chapter 6.  It is important for California teachers to see examples of Grade 2 students explaining 3-digit additions and subtractions with drawings because such work is in the CA CCSS and is important to do in Grade 2.  Such work enables third graders to concentrate on multiplication and division and just quickly review 3-digit adding and subtracting.   These drawings are on the next 3 pages.  They might be introduced by something like this: "Later in the year students work with drawings or objects to develop methods for adding and subtracting 3-digit numbers (2.NBT.7).  Written methods are important for many students for such larger numbers, and it is important that explanations of written methods be related to drawings.  In Figure 2.21 a Grade 2 student explains their method to the class and does such relating of the written method and the drawing.  This method is an easier standard algorithm invented by students in which the new groups are written below.  This makes it easier to see the totals of each column as a teen number and makes it easier to add each column of place values.  Classmates ask questions of the explainer.  In Figure 2.22 a student explains a simpler subtraction standard algorithm in which all ungrouping is done first.  This method eliminates errors students make with the traditional alternating standard algorithm in which they may forget to ungroup in a given column.  In such an explaining classroom, students also explain other methods, and the class discusses advantages and disadvantages of each method." Methods follow on three pages. Focus in Grade 2 (2011).

Reston, VA: The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Inc. pp. 88-89 Chapter 6 979:  Figure 6.15 Grade Two Content Connections, Big Ideas, and Content Standards Related to the above issues is a vital addition needed for the third row:  NBT.9 needs to be added to the list because NBT.9 specifies explaining and explaining is crucial to understanding.  Also NBT.5, 6, 7 concern multidigit addition and subtraction and not money.  These are crucial standards and need to be described in this table.  Add this text:  Connect these money values to place values and to 2-digit and 3-digit methods of adding and subtracting and explain such methods using drawings as needed. Also the end of the Big Idea in the fifth table row shown above needs this added:  Use these place values to develop understanding with 3-digit adding and subtracting. NBT.9 about explaining also could be added to this row. These additions to the Grade 2 table broaden the Big Ideas to crucially important Grade 2 concepts of meanings in multidigit addition and subtraction instead of the less important standards about dollars and cents and skip counting to 100. The Crucial Importance of Multiplication and Division in Grade 3 Chapter 6 1065:  Figure 6.16: Progression Chart of Big Ideas through Grades 3Ð5 The most important concepts in Grade 3 are multiplication and division.  Single-digit multiplication and division are introduced and come to fluency in Grade 3.  But these do not even appear in Figure 6.16.  Two small changes in Figure 6.16 can fix this. Change Addition and Subtraction Patterns in Figure 6.12 and Figure 6.53 to Patterns in Four Operations.

" 1	"I'm writing in support of the adoption of the 2023 Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten through Grade Twelve. This framework was written by professional educators of California's K12 Public School. Educators who work with diverse students populations and who understand their students' various needs when it comes to helping students make sense of mathematics and putting their learning into practical use. The emphasis on developing students critical thinking and problem solving skills will benefit every students in all their academics studies and life beyond school. Equally important is the frameworks attention to culturally responsive teaching and recognizing the importance of acknowledging and valuing students' diverse backgrounds and experiences. " 1	"I support the adoption of the new math framework. It was written by a team of experts and educators over an extended period of time. The new framework takes steps toward ensuring a more equitable and inclusive environment for math education for students from all different backgrounds. I love that it focuses on truly understanding mathematical concepts rather than memorization. It develops students' critical thinking and problem solving skills. It is critical that we adopt frameworks that recognize student's diverse experiences and is culturally responsive. It is also important that it includes computer science and data literacy since these skills are critical in today's job market. I urge you to support and adopt the 2023 math framework. " -1	"I write this letter to oppose the proposed California Math Framework. My comments are a distillation of a lengthier analysis presented in the Spring 2023 issue of Education Next, 'California's New Math Framework Doesn't Add Up.' The framework's stated purpose is "to support implementation of the California Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CA CCSSM)." The framework undermines the standards, in some cases directly contradicting them. The framework states: "Attaining fluency with multiplication and division within 100 accounts for a major portion of upper elementary grade students' work." How can that be? If students know multiplication facts "from memory" at the end of third gradeÑas stipulated in the state standards--why would they still be working on basic fact fluency in the upper elementary grades? But the claim is repeated: "Acquiring fluency with multiplication facts begins in third grade and development continues in grades four and five." (pg. 83) Note that California's 2013 math framework contained almost the exact same wording to describe third grade expectations. "Multiplication and division are new concepts in grade three, and reaching fluency with these operations within 100 represents a major portion of students' work. By the end of grade three, students also know all products of two one-digit numbers from memory (3.OA.7 )." A major portion of 3rd grade work will now become a major portion of the work in upper elementary grades. What a step backwards! What does fluent mean? The 2013 framework offers a clear definition, consistent with other states that adopted Common Core. "The word fluent is used in the standards to mean Ôreasonably fast and accurate' and possessing the ability to use certain facts and procedures with enough facility that using such knowledge does not slow down or derail the problem solver as he or she works on more complex problems." The new framework redefines fluency to discourage an emphasis on speed. The California Common Core Math Standards call for students to demonstrate an understanding of, and the ability to use, the standard algorithms of addition and subtraction by the end of fourth grade, multiplication by the end of fifth grade, and division by the end of sixth grade. These are culminating standards, not ironclad rules regarding when standard algorithms can and cannot be taught. The proposed math framework interprets these standards as banning the teaching of standard algorithms before the culminating grade, a false interpretation explicitly debunked by Jason Zimba, one of the Common Core co-authors. If this framework is adopted, California's students will encounter the standard division algorithm for the first time in sixth grade, years after most of the world has attained mastery. Please reject the proposed framework. " 1	"I am a 30+ year veteran teacher with National Board Certification as an Early Childhood Generalist. I also currently a Numeracy Interventionist with the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly a Primary Promise Math Intervention Teacher.

We must support teachers in the belief that all student are capable success in mathematics. Equity and inclusion are vital for the continued success of our state, so it is of vital importance that the Board take a stand in this matter by adopting this document.

This is equity, meaning no one advances past another. Unfortunately, we cannot be made equally intelligent; instead, schools can only ensure that no one has the opportunity to become more so. This equity push will come at a cost to America. America doesn't need every one of its citizens to be pros at math, but it needs some to be pros at it.

It prioritizes equitable teaching strategies and retains a focus on social justice. It presents a solid research base while also acknowledging the need for further study of high school pathways. Its focus on big ideas provides a way for educators to plan and implement instruction effectively. The three- dimensional schema provides a conceptual frame for the why (Drivers of Investigation), how (Standards for Mathematical Practice), and what (Content Connections) of mathematics instruction, bringing coherence to how we think about, plan, and implement learning experiences for our students. We have learned from past efforts. We know more about how students learn and the contexts in and conditions under which they thrive. We know more about effective teaching practices.

It is intended as a route for students who are challenged by algebra to learn some concepts related to real world data science in a less mathematically focused way. In principle this may be a reasonable goal for some students, but the actual curriculum here isn't much more than a repeat of data representation ideas from earlier grades. It utterly fails to build the conceptual framework for students to apply mathematical / quantitative reasoning to both abstract and real world physical phenomena. More directly: students who study this pathway instead of Algebra II / Integrated Math III will be hopelessly behind their peers when they enter colleges and universities in California or elsewhere. It is deeply ironic that this curriculum is called 'Introduction to Data Science', when any students entering any University of California campus from this pathway will have to take AT LEAST TWO algebra / precalculus classes before other prerequisites for the introductory Data Sciences courses! This will negatively impact time-to-degree and college readiness for potentially thousands of students. Most worrying: I fear that the California high schools with fewer resources will be tempted to offer the Data Science pathway INSTEAD of Algebra II / Integrated Math III. Students at such high schools are already seriously disadvantaged; this policy will only serve to increase the inequality and disadvantage those students now suffer.

" 1	"To: State Board of Education President Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond Re: Support for the Mathematics Framework Revised Draft for SBE Consideration As a Middle School Mathematics teacher for 36 years and the President of the California Math Council-North Section, I am urging the State Board of Education to adopt the Revised Draft Mathematics Framework. It will create a foundation for schools and districts to build upon as they strengthen their mathematics programs to ensure success in math for all students, especially as we are striving to support all learners to develop deep mathematical understanding and accelerate learning post-pandemic The Revised Draft Mathematics Framework supports a modernized mathematics sequence which offers multiple pathways that provide mathematically rich and rigorous options for students through: *content that expands views about what mathematics is, how it is vital to their lives, and why they should learn it, *a pedagogy that provides access for all students to learn rigorous mathematics regardless of race, gender, culture, religion, background, disability, or learning needs, and *a safe and inclusive learning environment that celebrates the diversity of mathematics and mathematicians. I believe our students deserve to have an organized delivery system of mathematics education and I believe our teachers deserve training to support the needs of all students. This Revised Draft Mathematics Framework provides guidance to our mathematical education community in order to support our administrators, coaches, teachers, and parents with the structure, pathways and decision-making policies that our students need now. Please adopt the Revised Draft Mathematics Framework so we can encourage, inspire, and support all students to appreciate the beauty and importance of mathematics in their lives. Professionally yours, Mary Ann Sheridan Middle School Mathematics Teacher (36 Years) California Math Council- North President Induction Program Coordinator " -1	"The proposed math curriculum has potential downsides including weakening foundational skills, reduced problem-solving abilities, inadequate preparation for higher education, diminished international competitiveness, exacerbated education disparities, and challenges in teacher preparedness. Weaker foundations can hinder students' career prospects in STEM fields, while reduced problem-solving skills limit their abilities in various disciplines. Inadequate preparation for higher education may hinder success in fields requiring strong mathematical foundations. The country's international competitiveness may suffer as graduates are less equipped to compete in research, innovation, and economic growth. Disadvantaged students may face additional barriers, perpetuating inequality. Teacher preparedness and professional development may be challenging, impacting effective adaptation to the new curriculum. " -1	"The proposed math curriculum in the education system can have several potential downsides: 1. Weakening foundational skills: The Proposed Math curriculum may result in a diminished emphasis on foundational math skills. These skills are crucial for advanced mathematical concepts and real-world applications. Weaker foundations can hinder students' abilities to pursue careers in STEM fields and may limit their overall mathematical competence. 2. Reduced problem-solving abilities: Rigorous math education fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By diluting the curriculum, students may miss out on opportunities to develop their analytical and logical reasoning abilities. This can have long-term consequences, as problem-solving skills are essential in various academic disciplines and in everyday life. 3. Limited preparedness for higher education: A less rigorous math curriculum may inadequately prepare students for the challenges they will encounter in higher education. Many disciplines, including engineering, computer science, economics, and physics, require strong mathematical foundations. Students may struggle to succeed in these fields if they haven't received a rigorous math education in their earlier years. 4. Impact on international competitiveness: This curriculum may negatively impact a country's competitiveness on the global stage. In an increasingly interconnected world, proficiency in mathematics is crucial for scientific research, technological innovation, and economic growth. This framework will impact out state of California and then USA will produce graduates who are less equipped to compete internationally in these domains. 5. Disparity in education quality: The proposed math curriculum may exacerbate existing disparities in education quality. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be disproportionately affected, as they often rely on education systems to provide them with opportunities to bridge the socio-economic gap. Weaker math education can perpetuate inequality by limiting their access to high-paying careers and advanced educational opportunities. 6. Teacher preparedness and professional development: Implementing this Math curriculum may require significant changes in teaching methodologies, instructional resources, and professional development for teachers. Adequate training and support for educators are essential to ensure they can effectively adapt their teaching strategies. Insufficient preparation can hinder teachers' ability to deliver quality math education, further compromising students' learning outcomes. " 1	"I am in full support of the adoption of the Revised Draft Mathematics Framework, which recommends research-based approaches that: - Provide access and future success for all students through creating a meaningful and rigorous mathematics experience beginning with early childhood education. - Encourage equitable outcomes through instructional design that includes: teaching big ideas; using open tasks; teaching toward social justice; supporting students' questions and conjectures; and prioritizing reasoning and justification. - Propose broadening the mathematics pathways offered so more students can learn algebra and take higher-level math coursework through a high school course sequence that allows for more student choice. The Revised Draft also recommends shifting from the use of remedial classes to a focus on acceleration and enrichment opportunities to better support all students. Educators, districts, schools, parents, and families use the CA Mathematics Framework to guide their math instructional programs, design professional development to build capacity across district systems, inform curriculum selection, and advocate for research-based math instruction that meets the needs of all learners. I encourage the SBE to vote to approve the 2023 Mathematics Framework to support CA districts in moving forward and creating a strong foundation for the field of mathematics education in California for the next eight years until the next framework is written and adopted. Districts are ready to adopt new curriculum materials better aligned to the CCSSM, but need the new framework to move forward with this process. I encourage the SBE to support California students and mathematics education statewide by voting to approve the 2023 Mathematics Framework. " -1	"The proposed mathematics framework is a looming disaster for California students. If approved, it will further sink California K-12 mathematics education below the lowly depths to which it has already sunk. Based on my 46 years of experience working in the most mathematically intense segment of the aerospace industry, I can assure you that the image of mathematics held by the authors of this framework is so alien to the reality of mathematics as it is practiced by those of us who actually do it for a living that it is barely recognizable let alone a model for mathematics instruction. First of all, math has nothing whatsoever do with fashionable Edu-speak obsessions such as race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, etc. In fact, several of the attributes of mathematics that make it so appealing to its practitioners worldwide are that it is universal, deals with truths that cannot be refuted, is undemocratic (does not depend on majority consensus for its veracity), and excludes appeals to authority as grounds for the acceptance of its conclusions. Another aspect of the framework that I find particularly objectionable is the false assertion, permeating the framework, that math has to be "relevant" to students' life experiences in order to be learned by them. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The fact is, that if competently taught, math is seen by most students to be an intrinsically fascinating subject in its own right, no matter which side of the tracks they call home. And this coming from me, a lifetime practitioner of applied, rather than pure, mathematics. California colleges of engineering are enrolling higher and higher proportions of foreign students who do not suffer from the handicap imposed upon American students by advocates of the concepts embodied in the proposed K-12 mathematics framework because fewer and fewer California students are acquiring the essential traditional math skills in K-12 necessary to handle twenty-first century engineering curricula. At greatest risk from the proposed framework are students from poor families, because their parents cannot afford to send them to Kumon or the Russian School of Mathematics Ð private businesses that thrive on successfully providing students with learning that compensates for the inadequacies of public school mathematics instruction, a state of affairs that also contributes significantly to the skewing of statistical studies of mathematics education outcomes in favor of wealthier students. California deserves better. I urge you to reject the proposed mathematics framework. " 1	"I am excited for the change to math education that this framework could bring. I appreciate the focus on supporting educators and the focus on creating equitable spaces for all kids to access strong math instruction. It's time to modernize math and I believe what's proposed in this framework is a great start! " -1	"We oppose the new California Math Curriculum that infuses social political beliefs and subjective viewpoints into the math curriculum. Math should remain objective. Opinions and beliefs on social and political issues have no place in math curriculum. With less than 40% of California students proficient in math (https://caaspp-elpac.cde.ca.gov/caaspp/), implementing and mastering the math content standards seems an urgent matter. Politicians should demonstrate they care more about facts than feelings especially when it comes to an objective subject matter. "Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.' _ George Orwell, 1984 " -1	"Only 33% of students in grades 3-8 and 11 achieved math proficiency. Teaching math for social justice will undoubtedly lead to further declines in academic performance and perpetuate the academic achievement gaps. To solve the public education crisis, we need to bring back rigorous instruction, keep up academic standards and revive merit.  " -1	"I believe the proposed Calif. Math Framework (CMF) would be HARMFUL to students, especially HARMFUL TO BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN. I say this as (a) a retired UC Davis professor who has taught math, statistics and computer science, and (b) as a lifelong activist on behalf of URMs (underrepresented minorities), starting with my work in 1968 on the congressional campaign of Myrlie Evers, a historic Black figure, my term as Chair of the UCD faculty Affirmative Action Committee, and so on. I make the following brief points: 1. The document is horribly biased, as seen in its failure to correct numerous serious factual errors pointed out after the earlier version was released; the failure to correct FACTUAL errors cannot be anything but deliberate. It has more than 25 citations of the research of ONE single person, with NO references to work by critics of the proposal. No critics were members of the advisory committee. The main concession made by the revised document seems to be mollifying parents who were worried their children would not be able to take calculus; those of us with broader concerns about the curriculum as a whole were ignored. 2. The negative impact on URM children, who are the most vulnerable in our society, would be devastating.The courses in data science and the like would be watered down to the point of uselessness (see below), and URMs would be shunted into these classes, which would be dominated by URMs. The classes would be known to the students as 'Black and Latino math,' a horribly stigmatizing situation. This ideologically-based playing with URM lives is absolutely unconscionable. 3. I have long experience teaching statistics, and can say unequivocally that the data science curricula would be useless. Yes, one can certainly teach data science without calculus, but Algebra 2 is an indispensable prerequisite. Data science is meaningless without a firm grasp of the concept of the slope of a line. I've looked at the LAUSD version of a data science curriculum, and is both superficial and riddled with conceptual errors. The UCLA lecturer who created the curriculum has also made serious conceptual errors in a YouTube video on college admissions. 4. That last ;point illustrates a more general principle: Data science is a highly nuanced field, which is easy to misuse. Even if the curriculum were revised to require Algebra 2, it would be quite difficult to obtain teachers with the needed depth in DS; a short training course would not suffice. I'm a Californian, born and raised, with a lifetime devotion to teaching. I have even taught municipal ESL courses, and a brief supplementary math course for 5th-graders at a local elementary school. And I've been fortunate to have won some teaching awards. I've thought long and hard about how young people learn math, especially URMs, and it pains me to see California kids being treated this way. Please do NOT approve this plan. " 1	"Finally a way of teaching math that gives everyone a chance! This framework is an absolute game-changer for equity in math education - and isn't learning meant to be creative, inspiring, thought-provoking and empowering for all? Not a memory test, often inapplicable to everyday real-life situations. If I had not been lucky enough to have a math teacher who saw some potential in me (when other teachers had given up) and taught me using more creative methods I never would have achieved the level of success in my exams and my career as I did - as well as an unshakable sense of self-belief and confidence in myself. I had a number of school friends with the same low-income background as me who were not so lucky- they found themselves stuck in an out-dated elitist system that judged them from day one and offered them no opportunity to recognise or reach their true potential. For these reasons I support this framework 100% - and it would be a tragedy if it were not to be passed.  " -1	"To the California State Board of Education: I strongly urge you to reject the proposed revision to the Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools. The proposed 2023 framework will substantially reduce how well students in California will learn math. This negative impact will be felt most significantly by minorities and the poor, whose only access to education is that provided by the public schools. As an engineering manager in Silicon Valley for over four decades, I have observed over time a decreasing percentage of qualified candidates for engineering jobs who had received their K-12 education in the United States. Rather than improve this situation, the proposed revision is a long step in the wrong direction, one that will deny many poor and minority students the opportunity to be hired into high-paying jobs in engineering and technology. In the best interest of California's students, I urge you to reject the proposed revision to the Mathematics Framework for Public Schools. Sincerely, Harry J. Levinson HJL Lithography Saratoga, CA " -1	"CA seems to be all set to make exactly the same disastrous mistake with Math that the US made for 40 years with reading Ð choosing an ideological approach with very weak evidence and ignoring a strong, evidence-based approach. In that instance the state, like the rest of the US, went down the Whole Language/Balanced Literacy path, rather than the strong, evidence-based Science of Reading path. It is pertinent to note in this context that while NY has apologized for its use of Balanced Literacy and has committed to Science of Reading, CA persists in using its failed methods to teach reading. So I suppose one should not be surprised that CA, with some of the lowest math achievement in the nation, now intends to make matters worse, with this dumbing down of math standards, and the insertion of "equity" and "social justice" rather than math achievement, as its guiding star. The framework makes claims that are blatantly false, such as ignoring research on the importance of math fluency ie: memorization of key facts and procedures; claiming that "reaching fluency with multiplication and division within 100 represents a major portion of upper elementary grade students' work" whereas the Common Core standards actually requires this fluency by third grade; claiming that having students invent algorithms for basic operations is "productive struggle" rather than a proven waste of time etc ad nauseum. Brian Conrad, Stanford math professor, has analyzed the citations in the framework, and shows that the findings of many studies are misrepresented. An analysis of the citations ALSO shows that the actual best math ed practices are NOT cited in the framework Ð instead, ideological and weak evidence is given priority. Proof is in this excerpt from https://www.educationnext.org/californias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up/ [https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.educationnext.org/californias-new-math-framework-doesnt-add-up/__;!!KOl5BGHrNw!etGFShMeBtebgN8e5IkTXFniusIpRL146k6GTPi_9b8NhoIW6QE7_hWgUbd3dbcv7GXFinIN6mFUU8fpy_ktOEU$] - "The What Works Clearinghouse, housed within the federal Institute of Education Sciences, publishes practice guides for educators. The guides aim to provide concise summaries of high-quality research on various topics. A panel of experts conducts a search of the research literature and screens studies for quality, following strict protocols. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies are favored because of their ability to estimate causal effects. The panel summarizes the results, linking each recommendation to supporting studies. The practice guides present the best scientifically sound evidence on causal relationships in teaching and learning. How many of the studies cited in the practice guides are also cited in the framework? To find out, I searched the framework for citations to the studies cited by the four practice guides most relevant to KÐ12 math instruction. Here are the results: Assisting Students Struggling with Mathematics: Intervention in the Elementary Grades (2021) 0 out of 43 studies Teaching Strategies for Improving Algebra Knowledge in Middle and High School Students (2015, revised 2019) 0 out of 12 studies Improving Mathematical Problem Solving in Grades 4 Through 8 (2012) 0 out of 37 studies Developing Effective Fractions Instruction for Kindergarten Through 8th Grade (2010) 1 out of 22 studies End of excerpt In short, the Framework is an ideological document that will push CA students even further down their already abysmal performance levels. Who will suffer? Affluent parents and Asians of all income levels will move heaven and earth and use outside resources to make sure their children learn math to the level needed. They will learn math, untainted by "social justice" propaganda and equity dumbing down. It is the low income students this Framework so piously claims to want to help who will be further crushed by it. " -1	"The math framework revision is based on gravely flawed research or in some cases no research at all. The framework recommends fairly drastic changes that are counterintuitive, and therefore the burden of proof falls on the recommenders to justify the changes. I believe that burden has not been met. The changes are not innocuous. I believe they will hurt all populations, including advanced learners and underserved communities. The treatment of certain subjects in the proposed high school courses do not satisfy the rigorous requirements the UC system demands. Students of those subjects will be unwittingly and undeservedly unprepared for college. I am a proponent of progressive education, but it must be based on solid research. This framework must be rejected. At this stage, I would hope that the next draft be given to a different set of authors who might be more capable of understanding the existing academic literature.  " -1	"For the record, I am pro-union, anti-racist, a democratic, pro-LGBTQ+, anti-privatization, and 100% an academic, who values truth above all other virtues. The Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools is still RIDDLED WITH CITATION ERRORS. The authors' claims are NOT SUPPORTED BY VALID EVIDENCE. I have been a math teacher in SFUSD for several years now. This is what I've seen over the past 10 years: An increased number of students are entering 9th grade without having their multiplication facts memorized, without the ability to perform operations with positive and negative integers, decimals, and fractions, without the ability to solve one-step, two-step, and muti-step equations (even with integers!), and without the ability to work independently. This has had a catastrophically negative effect on high school mathematics. The achievement gap has dramatically grown and so has the bipolarity within our classes. We're now forced to differentiate our instruction over *multiple* years; students who are entering 9th grade with less than a 5th grade level of math competency are grouped with students who are ready for precalculus. No one is getting the time, practice, and attention they need to thrive. " -1	"Math education is essential to competence of individuals and competitiveness of our state and nation.

ALM researchers and practioners work with adults who, for many reasons, have had poor experiences with mathematics at school. They build their teaching and learning interventions on the notions of relevance to learners life experiences and social justice. Using this approach brings mathematics to life in a real and tangible way which motivates and reignites interest in learning. The approaches to teaching outlined in this framework reflects these ideas and exemplifies how mathematics role in dealing with real and current challenges.

However, since 2012, the fraction of 13 year olds taking algebra has declined from 34% to 24%. The proposed framework is a step backwards, and poorly researched. I'm pleased with some of the changes Ð some culture war language was removed, explicit support for San Francisco's de-tracking experiments was removed and the recommendations to de-track without acceleration were softened, following debunking of the research that initially prompted them, and after the authors of research that was misrepresented spoke out. However, the fixes are very ad hoc and leave the framework inconsistent. The language around tracking is especially incoherent. The framework favors "grouping" in which students are assigned to classes of their skill level, but it's not considered tracking as it's not permanent. But authors seem to have reservation about this, as the framework pushes to delay grouping as late as possible Ð see "Productive Strategies for Teaching Diverse Students". This is justified on the basis that "engagement can fluctuate significantly during adolescent years"; but that would suggest grouping should be delayed until adulthood. Bizarrely, immediately after this remark, it suggests that high achieving students should be able to "to accelerate at any time" but doesn't distinguish that from grouping. The framework also discourages tracking compared to pathways because tracking locks in students to a certain set of courses in their future. Later, it recommends that students be placed into "pathways", which are sets of courses students plan to take in the future based on ability and interest. The recommendations around this topic, simply put, are very confused. Students are individuals who vary from one another, and any kind of one size fits all approach is silly, and will fail some of the children. Grouping should begin as soon as they show any differences in educational needs.

As a woman from the STEM field, a silicon valley based tech/impact investor and community builder/leader for positive inclusive change in society, I firmly believe this is a key moment to evolve the ways in which we teach math and other STEM subjects so that they are more inclusive and leave no child behind. Our state has a long way to go before we achieve educational equity and equal opportunity for all children (especially for girls and children of color) and this framework could be a great step in that direction. " 1	" Mathematics instruction in California can be more effective and equitable. In many CA districts, current teaching practices have resulted in only one-third of students scoring proficient in math on standardized measures across the state. Additionally, most students are being pushed out of high-level pathways at a young age. Lessons are often based on routine tasks taught with outdated methods, using narrow, procedural questions. This has had real consequences. Today, less than half of California students satisfy A-G requirements, thus limiting their choices and opportunities for college and careers. California has insufficient educators qualified to work in STEM. It has to hire thousands of people from other countries to address needs every year. Math education has historically been a gatekeeper to college and career success, preventing first-generation college-bound students, Black and Latine students, students with disabilities, and low-income immigrants from gaining entry to 4-year colleges and universities and high-paying STEM careers. These programs are part of a legacy of inequitable educational programs which use standardized tests and gifted programming to exclude Black students from gifted classrooms and relegate English Learner students into low-level educational pathways at an early age. These tests, often given in elementary school, have been used to sort label students as those who are 'good at math' and those who are not, and often determine who and who are not 'college material.' The revisions to the framework offer a better way to teach mathematics. Students will be taught through rich, engaging problems highlighting mathematical ideas and connections. Pathways will be opened up so more students can learn algebra and take higher-level math coursework. A mathematics course sequence that allows for more student choice. Students will be able to pursue a variety of pathways and choose rich and challenging courses that enable them to advance as their interests and aspirations evolve. Replacement of outdated tracking methods that segregated students into low-level remedial classes - with acceleration and enrichment opportunities open to more students. Schools have been implementing the ideas in the framework for many years, based on extensive scientific evidence, and have shown higher and more equitable outcomes. Decades of research and practice have demonstrated there are better models for math instruction. Methods that are creative, inclusive, culturally responsive, challenging, and affirming for all students and that engage students more effectively. Strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace. The revised framework was designed by a committee of 20 elected educators and five writers and has gone through a two-year process of public comments and revisions. As of April 2023, over 66 organizations and 2,800 educators, researchers and parents signed a letter of support for the California Math Framework. They include: The California County Offices of Education The California Mathematics Council The National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) The National Council for Supervisors of Mathematics (NCSM) Just Equations TODOS Ð Organization for Excellence and Equity in Mathematics Education Trust-West Center for Equity for English Learners at Loyola Marymount University California Partnership for Math and Science Education " -1	"1.

Research shows that when students have access to high-quality curricular resources and pedagogy -- as is recommended by the framework-- they do better in mathematics, in terms of achievement outcomes, participation patterns, and success in mathematics pathways long-term. The approach outlined in the framework is equitable, effective, conceptual, and empowering for students. The framework will support CA mathematics teachers, students, and families with a more humanizing approach to mathematics that supports students to develop deep, conceptual understanding of content, to connect it to their lives and to other subjects, and to author their own ideas. " 1	Please see the attached letter.  x -1	"Dear Members of the Board of Education, I am writing to express my concerns regarding certain educational frameworks that have been implemented and their potential ramifications on the quality of public education in our state. As a concerned citizen invested in the well-being of our education system, I believe it is crucial to address these issues to ensure the future success of our students. Firstly, I would like to draw your attention to the concept of an 'anti-merit statewide framework.' While I understand the importance of promoting equality in education, it is essential to strike a balance between providing equal opportunities and maintaining high academic standards. Lowering standards in the name of equal outcomes could potentially compromise the quality of education our students receive. I kindly request that the Board of Education carefully considers the long-term effects of any policy changes and strives to find a middle ground that promotes both equality and excellence in education. Secondly, I would like to emphasize the increasing need for competent engineers, scientists, mathematicians, and other STEM talents in our society. The advancements and challenges of the modern world necessitate a strong focus on STEM education. It is crucial that our public education system provides students with the necessary skills and knowledge in these fields. Therefore, I urge the Board of Education to prioritize and invest in quality STEM education, ensuring that our students are well-prepared to tackle the demands of the future. Lastly, I would like to express my reservations regarding an 'equity-themed math framework.' While it is important to address systemic inequalities and foster inclusive learning environments, it is equally essential to maintain a rigorous and balanced approach to mathematics education. Incorporating diverse perspectives and real-life applications in math can enhance students' understanding and engagement. However, it is imperative to ensure that any equity-focused frameworks do not compromise the development of fundamental mathematical skills. I kindly request the Board of Education to approach these frameworks with careful consideration and maintain a strong emphasis on mathematical excellence while promoting equity objectives. I believe that our education system plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of our society. By addressing these concerns and finding a balance between equality and excellence, we can provide our students with a high-quality education that prepares them for the challenges and opportunities they will face. Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust that the Board of Education will give due attention to these concerns and take appropriate actions to ensure the best possible educational outcomes for our students. Sincerely, Nirit Luchans Parent " 1	"Dear California State Board of Education: New Classrooms is a national nonprofit on a mission to personalize education through the development and advocacy of innovative and competency-based solutions. This includes innovative learning models, which support teachers by integrating precise diagnostics, high quality content, embedded formative assessment and personalized personal pathways that span multiple grade levels. These models are designed to better meet the unique strengths and needs of every student. We commend the State of California for incorporating critical changes into the third draft of the Mathematics Framework. This revision represents a significant departure from traditional, uniform, one-size-fits-all, grade-level textbook based learning. It now includes a vital grade-band structure for K-5, 6-8 and 9-12. This framework should be used across all aspects of the system to unlock personalized, competency-based designs and instructional programs that meet all of California's students where they are and provide them with a personalized pathway to college and career readiness. We are happy to lend our support to the adoption and promotion of this Framework. __ Michael S. Watson Vice President, Policy and Advocacy New Classrooms " 1	"Please adopt the new math framework. I am a veteran teacher of over 20 years and am in full support of the new math framework. Thank you! " 1	"To whom it may concern: I am a high school math teacher in Chino, CA. I have taught since 2011. I have been teaching IM1 since 2014. So, my comments are limited to that area since it has been my focus for the past decade. I hope that the comments I've written are read with the understanding that all we want to do as teachers is make it so that students learn, remember what they learn and we have some fun in the process too! Covid definitely made things clear for us all and sent many packing! I am still here, so are my colleagues, lets work together to figure out the best way to have kids learn math! Here are my comments/thoughts - Page 5 line 122; '...create equations to describe situations.' Can weave into the framework the need to understand how creating an equation can lead to creating a function and thus the difference between the two. Thanks! Page 6 line 131 and 132; 'They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change.' Are you referring to arithmetic and geometric sequences without using those terms? Why? Are teachers bothered by them? Please be specific, although I realize this is a framework and inherently general, I feel that arithmetic and geometric sequences and subsequently, the idea of recursive and explicit forms are a pillar within Mathematics I. Please refers to them explicitly (no pun intended) to help emphasize their importance. Page 6 line 139; '...assessing how a model fits data. They use regression techniques to describe...' Can someone, somewhere, maybe not here in the framework, please talk about the difference between a line of fit (done manually using two points), a line of best fit (done electronically using a graphing calculator like desmos) and the line of regression. Maybe a general statement acknowledging that in mathematics we use multiple terms to describe the same thing would suffice. Just a thought. Page 6 lines 143 - 147; Due to the structure of the Integrated Pathway, and the natural emphasis math teachers tend to put on algebra, I feel it is necessary to make it 1000% clear that geometry must be an ESSENTIAL standard in Mathematics 1. Too often, I have seen geometry placed on the back burner or referred to as a nice to know standard. The geometry is where the beauty and art in mathematics comes alive. Teachers don't know how to teach it this way. We need materials that take students from (order could vary) constructing a triangle, to transforming a triangle in the coordinate plane, to using constructions and transformations to prove triangles congruent. Teachers are not teaching it that way. They are compartmentalizing these topics and it's a missed opportunity. No one in public education taught it to me in this way, truly. We need to reeducate our educators and get them to buy into the idea that this will have more meaning to our students and therefore translate to deeper understanding and long term retention. (It's lofty, but I've experienced it in micro moments in the classroom.) Page 12 line 313; Please, remove the word cancellation. I refrain from saying this word to my students. I use the word simplify, because cancellation refers to x/x cancelling each other out, when in fact they are simplifying to 1. Please use simplify instead! Just my two cents! " -1	" The belief that, if all students were equal, discrimination would cease to exist, is an exercise in stupidity. The cure would be worse than the disease. Imagine, a world with eight billion, exactly the same, equal people. Dumb people have a very difficult time becoming smarter. So, to achieve equity, everyone not already a dolt would need to be educated to become doltish. Evidently, eradicating discrimination requires leveling the playing field. This seems to be the thrust of the 2023 Mathematics framework. Artificially holding back advanced students benefits no one but harms all. In an attempt to keep failing math students from feeling bad, they propose holding advanced students back. This will not achieve the desired effect. Failing students will still feel bad about themselves. Held back students are likely to feel extremely angry at the handicapping. The indoctrination of social justice and identity politics are not Math and when embedded in the curriculum, deprive all of a Math education The State Board of Education's advancing of this Math framework has an agenda opposed to merit and excellence. More than likely, they've imbibed their own "Kool Aid." " -1	"There is nothing wrong with merit-based math instruction. The achievement gap problem has been intractable because of underlying problem/s--be they social or economic. Teaching for equity does more harm than good, especially since there is no adequately proven record for it. Too many families have already been negatively impacted, particularly Asian Americans. More research needs to be done before a radical approach like teaching for equity is adopted. Given that students are doing poorly and that resources are finite, we must teach to bring out the very best in each student; that means restoring merit. The anti-merit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes, would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education. The promise of America is one of equal opportunities, not equal outcomes. America needs competent engineers, scientists, mathematicians and other STEM talents, more than ever. We simply can't allow public education to keep spinning downwards. Talented students should be acknowledged for their ability to rise above, instead of being held back for the sake of others. The equity-themed math framework is playing with fire by conducting an ideological experiment on our next generation. My siblings and children have been subjects of untold numbers of FAILED education experiments, including busing, racial quotas, Dream Schools, and a multi-million dollar federal Consent Decree. " -1	"My children have attended school in Fremont Unified School District. During elementary school there is no option for accelerated math learning. My kids were offered 'differentiation' and 'deeper learning'. These options are wholly inadequate and unchallenging. It is bad enough that kids that are good at math have to be bored in math for all of elementary school, but to extend this to middle and high school is ridiculous. The current educational system convinced my kids that they didn't like math, although they are all very good at it. My middle child is going to be a senior this year, and she finally started enjoying math in High School, when she was being challenged by the course work. Teachers, in reality, do not offer more challenging math work to kids who are good at math. The revised plan is only paying lip service to advance learners without any substance. California will surely continue to decline in math achievement when you take your best students and offer them the 'opportunity' to tutor failing students rather than let them learn. " -1	"Math is a basic skill and foundation of science. It has nothing to do with justice.

America needs competent engineers, scientists, mathematicians and other STEM talents. We simply can't allow public education to keep spinning downwards. " 1	"I strongly support the idea of "Teaching for Equity and Engagement" which lays out the following five components of equitable math education: 1. Plan teaching around big ideas. 2. Use open, engaging tasks. 3. Teach toward social justice. 4. Invite student questions and conjectures. 5. Prioritize reasoning and justification. This is how math education supports democracy. As a veteran of over 40 years of teaching mathematics at the secondary level, I found this to help combat math anxiety and improve student mathematical performance. Please, do not change this. Thank you. Sincerely, H William Marthinsen " 1	"Dear State Board of Education, Mathematics instruction can be more effective and engaging. To do so, math must be creative, inclusive, culturally responsive, challenging, and affirming for all students. It must be based on strategies that have demonstrated results in allowing students to make meaning, think critically, and progress at their own pace. Jo Boaler and a committee of educators and writers have gone through a vetted two year process and their proposed new math framework deserves our support. Sincerely, Tim Zalunardo Executive Director Educational Services Santa Rosa City Schools " 1	"All children deserve access to a high-quality mathematics education. I support the adoption of proposed revisions to the CA Math Framework. CA students from all backgrounds deserve to be visible in the curriculum and that includes mathematics instruction.

Students are counting on your vote to affirm recommendations supported by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Just Equations, TODOS and many other organizations that support equitable math instruction. " 1	"I think it is important we bring our math up to closer to the world standard and this seems like a good start. It is important that people understand why they are learning something and how it effect them. Inclusion and diversity are important in all facets of education, including but not limited to math.

" 1	"I support the approval of the mathematics framework. Equity is an important goal in math education. During my years in the classroom, I was able to provide deep understanding to a wide variety of students enrolled in the same course. At the same time, their different ways of learning and understanding often benefited each other -- the connection between more concrete and more abstract thinking became visible to everyone, rather than the struggling students becoming mired in the concrete, and the stronger students relying on memorization of procedures. Most of my students went on to good four year colleges, including UCs and highly competitive private schools. After high school when I saw them in the community, or when they wrote to me, they would tell me that they felt well prepared in a multi-level math class for their college curriculums. Another thing I would like to point out is that standardized tests (aside from IB/AP tests) aren't a good measure of what students know because they are designed to compare students, not as mastery tests. Given that current students had at least two disrupted academic years because of Covid (and don't forget that many lost family members, and/or experienced long illnesses of caregivers or themselves), test outcomes are even more questionable than usual. The point of math is that students learn it deeply enough to succeed in the next class, and like math enough to continue taking it in College, or using it in the workplace. Thus, I reiterate my support of the framework which will help achieve that goal.

The current draft of the revised framework, chapter 8, reinforces the need for coverage of the standards for college readiness, but does so with too much subtly and ambiguity.

One example that is already offered by some 733 districts (and is University of California AÐG approved) is Financial Algebra. In this 734 course, students engage in mathematical modeling in the context of personal finance 735 (this course is comparable in rigor to a Mathematics III or Algebra II course; it is not the 736 same as a "Consumer Math" or "Accounting and Finance" class currently offered by 737 some schools, which are not UC AÐG approved). Through this modeling lens, they 738 develop understanding of mathematical topics from advanced algebra, statistics, 739 probability, precalculus, and calculus. Instead of simply incorporating a finance-focused 740 word problem into each Algebra II lesson, this course incorporates the mathematics 741 concept when it applies to the financial concept being discussed. For example, the 742 concept of exponential functions is explored through the comparison of simple and 743 compound interest; continuous compounding leads to a discussion of limits; and tax 744 brackets shed light on the practicality of piecewise functions. In this way, the course 745 ignites students' curiosity and ultimately their engagement. The scope of the course 746 covers financial topics, such as taxes, budgeting, buying a car/house, (investing for) 747 retirement, and credit, and develops algebra and modeling content wherever it is 748 needed. "Never has mathematics seemed so relevant to students as it does in this 749 course," says one teacher. 750 Another third-year course currently offered by several districts is a Data Science course. 751 Data science courses usually have a broader focus on reasoning with data. Because 752 data science is still an emerging field with changing implications in the KÐ12 landscape, 753 some data science courses are constructed to develop the elements of Mathematics III 754 content within the course, while others might require students to already have 755 encountered the full Mathematics IÐIII content. As such, Data Science might be either a 756 third- or fourth-year course, depending on the content included. In keeping with the 757 University of California (UC) updated mathematics (area C) course criteria and 758 guidelines, a course approved as "advanced" may be used to satisfy the third or fourth 32 759 year requirement provided it "substantially align with Common Core (+) standards" and 760 therefore relies upon the foundational Common Core content. 761 Any of these third-year courses could lead to a range of fourth-year options as set out in 762 the course diagram above (figure 8.4). If students take another third-year course 763 (besides Mathematics III or Algebra II), they should be made aware that they are 764 leaving the usual pathway for taking Calculus in high school or in their first semester of 765 college (as is expected in some universities for STEM majors). While many colleges 766 and universities accept a wide range of mathematical backgrounds and provide 767 pathways for students in STEM majors to complete Calculus in their first year, others 768 expect to see incoming STEM majors having completed the content of Mathematics 769 III/Algebra II followed by a precalculus and/or calculus course. 770 College Expectations and Sample Student Pathways By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, 1 771 students will satisfy the 772 requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that 773 requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of 774 graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I. 775 Depending upon their post-secondary goals, students may choose different third- and 776 fourth-year courses, and all college-intending students should complete four years of 777 mathematics in high school to meet California State University and University of 778 California recommendations. 779 Giving students a choice of pathways through their last two years of high school can 780 elevate a student's real-world application of mathematics understanding. The variety of 781 pathways reflect the many different interests and aims of students, such as those 782 seeking employment directly after high school; others whose objective is a career 783 requiring a university degree in a quantitative field (including STEM and data science) or 784 a social science field that heavily uses statistics (such as sociology, psychology, 785 economics, or political science); others who are interested in a university degree in a 1 Note that the second course (beyond Algebra I or Mathematics I) can be any mathematics course of the student's choosing." 1	"Recent changes to the University of California mathematics area C standards have been misinterpreted to mean the UC and CSU no longer consider exposure to the full range of common core state standards in mathematics as necessary for college and career readiness.

While many colleges 766 and universities accept a wide range of mathematical backgrounds and provide 767 pathways for students in STEM majors to complete Calculus in their first year, others 768 expect to see incoming STEM majors having completed the content of Mathematics 769 III/Algebra II followed by a precalculus and/or calculus course. 770 College Expectations and Sample Student Pathways By completing Algebra I and Geometry or Mathematics I and II, 1 771 students will satisfy the 772 requirements of California Assembly Bill 220 of the 2015 legislative session that 773 requires students to complete two mathematics courses in order to receive a diploma of 774 graduation from high school, with at least one course meeting the rigor of Algebra I. 775 Depending upon their post-secondary goals, students may choose different third- and 776 fourth-year courses, and all college-intending students should complete four years of 777 mathematics in high school to meet California State University and University of 778 California recommendations. 779 Giving students a choice of pathways through their last two years of high school can 780 elevate a student's real-world application of mathematics understanding. The variety of 781 pathways reflect the many different interests and aims of students, such as those 782 seeking employment directly after high school; others whose objective is a career 783 requiring a university degree in a quantitative field (including STEM and data science) or 784 a social science field that heavily uses statistics (such as sociology, psychology, 785 economics, or political science); others who are interested in a university degree in a 1 Note that the second course (beyond Algebra I or Mathematics I) can be any mathematics course of the student's choosing." -1	"The anti-merit statewide framework is to lower standards in the name of equal outcomes, would have disastrous ramifications on the quality of public education.

" 1	"Thank you for considering my comment stating my support of the proposed Mathematics Framework. As the Associate Superintendent for the Campbell Union School district I see the need for urgent change in math teaching and learning. Students are increasingly less engaged in math, performance is steadily declining in our state, and students lack access to high quality instruction. The problem is far greater for marginalized students, leading to a significant and ongoing lack of diversity in math related fields. The framework supports teaching through the use of rich and engaging tasks that offer real world experiences. It creates more opportunity for applied mathematics that will help shape our future career fields through the recommendation of various pathways for success. Finally, it is essential that we abolish tracking that allows some students to access higher math skills, while others are placed in sub-par programs. Please approve this framework so that educators can do the work that we know will lead to better outcomes for California's students. The time for positive change is NOW!
